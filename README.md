## Inspiration
While working on generating sentences using Markov Chains, I thought it would be funny to have a "rap" corpus to work from.  There was no rap corpus to download, so I wrote a script to download the lyrics for each rap song on genius.com to its own text file.

## How to Use RapLyricScraper
Simply do "python rapLyricScraper.py".  The text files with the lyrics for each song will be saved in the "scrapedRapLyrics" folder.

## Other
This script will take a while to run.  It's best to let it run and come back in an hour or so.
