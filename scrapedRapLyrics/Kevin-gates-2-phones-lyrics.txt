Hello? What the deal? Bet

Button start the foreign, oh my God I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket
Parking lot might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Brick comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin Im ring, ring, ringin
Countin money while they ring, ring, ringin
Trap jumpin' Im ring, ring, ringin

Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just high yella you not that important
Weight, shape her,
Smell like tartar, I'mma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
