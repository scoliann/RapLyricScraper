New York City
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?
[BURR]
That depends. Whos asking?
Oh, well, sure, sir
Im Alexander Hamilton, Im at your service, sir
I have been looking for you
Im getting nervous
Sir
I heard your name at Princeton.
I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. Its a blur, sir. He handles the financials?
BURR
You punched the bursar
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two,
then join the revolution
He looked at me like I was stupid, Im not stupid
So howd you do it? Howd you graduate so fast?
It was my parents dying wish before they passed
Youre an orphan. Of course! Im an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that were worth more
Than anyone bargained for

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice
While were talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less
[HAMILTON]
What?
Smile more
[HAMILTON]
Ha
[BURR]
Dont let them know what youre against or what youre for

[HAMILTON]
You cant be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

Good luck with that: youre takin a stand
You spit. Im a sit. Well see where we land
[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]

If you stand for nothing, Burr, whatll you fall for?
