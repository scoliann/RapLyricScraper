My girl like it rough she said find me a diamond

Too much dirty money when the colors

Realized I dont need that shit

Fifty mill in one room
, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And theyll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think theyre hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
Im like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But its all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where Im tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we aint ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see Im runnin' out of space
Mothafucka thats grindin'
Nigga Im grindin for all my shit
Grindin for all my shit
Yeah, Im grindin for all my shit
I put time into all this shit

I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Then peek inside the safe and say Im running out of space
Believe that
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out,
