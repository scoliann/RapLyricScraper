Smokin' weed with you
Cause you taught me to
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Every morning when I wake up
Money on my mind,
good time to get caked up
Sunshine coming through my blinds,
Im living, but
Really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA
Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him
Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on, to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority,
order me
Hennessey
and for my niggas
OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job,
boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks,
let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh,
if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees,
double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling,
anything, I by that ocean
I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean,
ain't nobody fucking with this
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time,
I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don't fuck with no hand me downs
See if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'mma make it work?
You know her dress slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first, Cali
