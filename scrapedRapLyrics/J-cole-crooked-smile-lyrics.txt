[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one
that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill, cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked  look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows; thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman
I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on,
stare in the mirror
But it's clear that you cant face whats wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile, this crooked smile
[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one
that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round
[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl, you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands cant touch, that them broads cant be
And thats you.
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, Ill be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you aint laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
[Hook]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one
that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back round)
(You were the one that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round)
[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase em
Look at the nation
Thats a crooked smile braces couldnt even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, cause we in Hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, lets make a mil
Hey officer man, we dont want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, I'm well now
If you asking will I tell now  aye, hell nah
I aint snitching cause man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldnt need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?
[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one
that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back round)
(You were the one that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round)
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
On my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way down
You were the one
that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round
Back 'round
You were the one
that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round
Back 'round
You were the one
that was tryin' to keep me way down
But like the sun, now you know I find my way back 'round
