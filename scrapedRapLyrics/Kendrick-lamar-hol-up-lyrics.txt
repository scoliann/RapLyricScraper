I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for dollars, I know you dying to meet 'em
I'll prolly die in a minute, just bury me
With 20 bitches, 20 million, and a Comptown fitted
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Yeah, big shit popping, Section.80
Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch, with my back against the wall
And your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump-off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling with the speed
Of a lightning bolt,
as a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my 20's at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like '87
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? There's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Yeah, big shit poppin
Hey, hey, kick her out the studio, Ali
24/7 nigga, working his ass for it, she popping that ass for it
The King of Diamonds with diamonds I never do ask for
They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with Customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff 'em
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor, you'll never hop in my lane
When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed: it was a honor, hold up
