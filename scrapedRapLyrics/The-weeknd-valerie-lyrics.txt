There comes a time in a man's life
Where he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
And there are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say
Like I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (to put)
My hand on another girl
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know
Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
Valerie (oh, Valerie)
I know you can see through me
(I know you can see through my lies)
Valerie (oh, Valerie)
You just choose to never know
(No, you just dont know what I do, what I do, oh, Valerie)
Valerie
Why pretend to trust in me?
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I know)
Valerie (I know, Valerie)
You'd rather this than be alone
Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
And I love you
(Cause I love you baby)
And I need you
(When I need, need)
I only want you
And nobody gonna know...
