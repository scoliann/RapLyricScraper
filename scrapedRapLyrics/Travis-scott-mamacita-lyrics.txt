Mamacita, cita, cita
Mamacita, cita, cita
This the last days to the rodeo, last night
Had me down in the back, comatose, don't think
Sun shades and a pill gon' help
Once I'm gone, can't tame myself
Mamacita, cita, cita
You know I really need yah, need yah, need yah, right now
She get freaky when the... light's down
The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down
With the head first, got her straight out of the night gown
They got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it
3-D money, no illusion
Depending if I'm feelin' bougie
Might hit your line bitch
Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her
And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita
Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
Mothafuck a girl
I love her, I'mma give her the world
Aye fuck her, I wanna fuck her mother
Just might give her my little girl
No, no, I won't let go,
roll down, oh
She look the best with a fro, natural nat-nat on go
Damn, Quan, turn on the stove, whip it 'til I have a stroke
I do not fuck with America, I get it straight off the boat
Oh damn, the kush it never make me choke
Slow down, I'm speedin' and I got a trunk full of wham
Damn, 25 thousand on an old school Cam
SS me,
these bitches wanna molest me
Damn, they'll sex me, she a lesbi
She want chicken like sesame
And she tryin' to undress me, test me
Give her hotel keys like Cassidy, 'u digg'?
Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her
And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita
Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my bad little college ho
That I got on the east skirts of Decatur
Best believe that she cover Rich Homie Quan like a blazer
I smoke a lot of weed, keep my music turned up, fuck my neighbors
I fuck a nigga bitch and turn her like a table
Aye, Im still practicin' so you know Im gettin' greater
Aye, still wearin' long socks and shorts like Fabo
He was hatin' at first, now he tryna make the payroll
Got a stupid bitch who do whatever I say so
Money on my head like a Jesus piece
Blunt, now I'm higher than Khalifa be
Bad bitch lookin' like a Filipina
Ohh, you're killin' me, ohh, remember me
You, finna be
deceased if you keep callin' me
Therefore I
Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her
And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita
Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita (Mamacita, cita, cita)
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
