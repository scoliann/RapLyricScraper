[Intro: Chris Brown]
I dont see how you can hate from outside of the club, you cant even get in
Ha ha ha
leggo
Yellow model chick
yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini
yellow top missing
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in ten years, in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh Im getting paper
Look at me now, oh look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker
Lil nigga, bigger than gorilla
Cause Im killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I aint really mean to say on my dick
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
Im done
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo Breezy,
let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there, homie
let's go
Cause I'm feeling like Im running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
See they really really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Everytime I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing
that nigga think that he be doing
Cause it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
a ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing
I gotta do a lot of things that make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again, and again, and then again
And I be doing it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style
and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm banging in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh Im getting paper
Look at me now, oh look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker
Man, fuck these bitch ass niggas, how yall doing?
Im Lil Tunechi,
Im a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I dont eat sushi,
Im the shit, no, Im pollution,
no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas aint eatin, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then Im like ol
I dont care what you say, so dont even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
Thats word to my flag, and my flag red
Im out of my head, bitch Im outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You aint hotter than mine, nope
Not on my time and Im not even trying
What's popping, slime?
Nothing five,
and if they trippin fuck em five
I aint got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas, as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right,
and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice
and my daddys dead
You faggots scared cause Im too wild
Been here for a while
I was like fuck trial
I puts it down
Im so Young Money
If you got eyes look at me now, bitch
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh Im getting paper
Look at me now, oh look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker
is that right?
