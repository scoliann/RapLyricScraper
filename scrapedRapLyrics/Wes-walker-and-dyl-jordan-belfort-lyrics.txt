Jordan Belfort -- Jordan Belfort
I've been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Sipping on Ciroc, trip 'em up with the words
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third
Jordan Belfort -- Jordan Belfort
I been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
I just flipped a birdy, money so dirty
Got my bitch a mink, furry like Furby
I came up, made a milly, spent it on a rollie
Stackin gouda, feta, chedda cheese and ravioli
Or maybe fettuccine,
dirty martini
I'mma fuck your bitch, call me Houdini
I'm drivin' Lamborghini, your ho in a bikini
Eight bottles to the neck, three wishes from a genie
Benjamin ain't dirty, but these Franklins be filthy
Always going to court, but I'm never pleadin' guilty
Ballin' so hard I only be slam dunkin
Beat steady rockin' and the trunk straight thumpin'
I be ridin' foreign pourin' merlot while I swerve
Pedal to the medal when I'm whippin' round the curve
And I'm rollin' up this marijuana, you can smell the herb
And I be getting all this lettuce and I ain't talkin' iceberg
I've been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Sipping on Ciroc, trip 'em up with the words
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third
Jordan Belfort -- Jordan Belfort
I been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Jordan Belfort, Burberry shirt
LV loafers on my sofa in Bel-Air
Turnin' up daily cause we can't turn down at work
I been lightin' loud lately like my volume switch don't work
And my cologne is Versace,
Medusa got me stoned
I'm always high on something, but I usually like to smoke
We been long time friends, me and Ben Frank
Every fucking day he needs a ride home from the bank
Muhfucka you don't know me, you ain't in my tax section
My wallet ain't fat, it's in the gym straight flexing
I don't call your bitch back and she's checkin' her reception
Bitch with double D's, she's all up on my erection
And I'm in the ovaries, but I ain't about affection
So easily the sober me just smokes and then forgets them
Sometimes this life seems a little stressful
Especially when they tell me that I am something special
I've been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Sipping on Ciroc, trip 'em up with the words
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third
Jordan Belfort -- Jordan Belfort
I been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
