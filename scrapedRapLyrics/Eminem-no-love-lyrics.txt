[Intro: sampled]
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world!", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to Hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go 'round fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I've got my gun,
semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth
So I guess it's "Fuck what they say!"
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in the cage
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker
Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
[Hook: Eminem and Lil Wayne]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me)
That's right (don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't want to see you (no more)
Bitch, you get (no love)
You showed me nothin' but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right (don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't want to see you (no more)
Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love, no love)
Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love)
And I don't need you (no more); get 'em!
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life;
I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than, most
Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, and I stick it in
I ain't never givin' in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak
Cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em
Bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah, that rap was tight
But I'm 'bout spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
My soul started to rot, fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not going to stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it
Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow;
you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless,
I smell blood
I don't give a fuck:
keep giving 'em hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
[Hook: Eminem and Lil Wayne]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me)
That's right (don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't want to see you (no more)
Bitch, you get (no love)
You showed me nothin' but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right (don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't want to see you (no more)
Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love, no love)
Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Ha! Bitch, you get no love
