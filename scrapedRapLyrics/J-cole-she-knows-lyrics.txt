[Intro: J.Cole]
She knows, she knows
Hey
[Background Sample: Amber Coffman]
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly Ive never had much sympathy
Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
Oh I, oh I-I-I (Im gonna run run away, run run away, run away)
Well alright (Run away and never come back)
Oh I, oh I-I-I(Run run away, run run away, run away show em that your)
Well alright (color is black)
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch In his ear
Sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta
[Hook: J.Cole]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I cant be what you want from me
Well alright
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, that she want
What she want from a nigga
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
Cause I told her I was sleep
Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I cant be what you want from me
Well alright
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie
[Outro: J.Cole]
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright
