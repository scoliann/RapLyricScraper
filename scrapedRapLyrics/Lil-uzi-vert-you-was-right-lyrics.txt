Hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you
(If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you)
Crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
(Metro Boomin' want some more, nigga)
Ya alright, alright, alright
You was right I was wrong
Ya I should've never ever took her home
Ya I should've just boned
Ya fantasy on my phone
Ya hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you
Ya crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
Talking about a broken heart running to the restroom
Looked at my momma just like we rich
Looked at my bitch like we rich
Said we ain't got no minor setbacks
Counting all that money told that nigga just to bet that
I, I know that you ain't got it boy why you ain't just say that
They see I got that money, now his bitch like I said that
I don't pay that hoe no mind I been had that
When I saw my girl ya you know I had to bag that
And before me fuck niggas ya they had that
Five niggas in including me I had to back back
Try to diss me I take it to your family
I fuck your sister then make sure that she vanish
Ya alright, alright, alright
You was right I was wrong
Ya I should've never ever took her home
Ya I should've just boned
Ya fantasy on my phone
Ya hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you
Ya crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
Talking about a broken heart running to the restroom
Ya alright, alright, alright
You was right I was wrong
Ya I should've never ever took her home
Ya I should've just boned
Ya fantasy on my phone
Ya hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you
Ya crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
Talking about a broken heart running to the restroom
Even though we in the same room
You just locked the door so I gotta text you
Like bae unlock the door I got to use the restroom
Like I don't want to war want to caress you
Ya alright, alright, alright
You was right I was wrong
Ya I should've never ever took her home
Ya I should've just boned
Ya fantasy on my phone
Ya hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you
Ya crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
Talking about a broken heart running to the restroom
