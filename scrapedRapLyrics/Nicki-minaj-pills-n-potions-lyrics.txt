Pills n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
Were overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin wasnt tasteful
Even though you out here lookin so ungrateful
I'mma keep it movin be classy and graceful
I told 'em its no friends in the game, you aint learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, dont burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible, that
They love you, when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still dont wish death on em, I just reflect on 'em
Pills n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
Were overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
Yo, people will love you and support you when its beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out a niggas life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good now, its kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy,
I see the envy, when Im causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em,
cop cribs in the hills, on em
Pills n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
Were overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time well be fine
In due time
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
