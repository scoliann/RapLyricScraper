[Court Officer: The D.O.C.]
Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A vs. the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?
Fuck the police coming straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fucking with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold
and a pager
Searching my car, looking for the product
Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished,
bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swoll off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo Dre, I got something to say
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
[Scene 1]
[Cop] Pull your god damn ass over right now
[Ren] Aww shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
[Cop] Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
[Ren] Man, fuck this shit
[Cop] Aight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm stepping
And the motherfucking weapon is kept in
A stash box
for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
Fuck you punk
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'mma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfucking villain that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
{*BOOM, BOOM*}
Yeah, something like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
[Scene 2]
[Cop] (*knocking on the door*)
[Eazy] Yo man, what you need?
[Cop] Police, open out!
[Eazy] Aww shit
[Cop] We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
[Cop] Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em
(Move motherfucker, move now!)
[Eazy] What the fuck did I do, man what did I do?
[Cop] Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
[Eazy] But I didn't do shit
[Cop] Man just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
I'm tired of the motherfucking jacking
Sweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass -- or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
Cause the police always got something stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(MC Ren: Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
The verdict
[Dre] The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
[Cop] But wait, that's a lie! That's a god damn lie!
[Dre] Get him out of here!
[Cop] I want justice
[Cop] I want justice!
[Dre] Out, right now!
[Cop] Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
Fuck Tha Police
