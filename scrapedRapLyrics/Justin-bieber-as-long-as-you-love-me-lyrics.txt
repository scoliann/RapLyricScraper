Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress and don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there
Girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without 'U'
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out, like woah, oh God
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me "What's my best side?"
I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
You love me, you love, that's all I want baby
As long as you love me, you love me, please don't go
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me, yeah
As long as you love me
