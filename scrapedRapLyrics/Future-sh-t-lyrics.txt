Oh, you know you ain't got all them guns
And you ain't killed nobody yet
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit
Shit,
shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit
Shit,
shit
Bought the ho a hunned pair of red bottoms
That's a quarter milli' on a hand job my nigga
Blllll stick'em
Fuck you and every nigga came witcha
Gone put a nigga on a picture
Gone put a nigga on a t-shirt
Back in the day when a nigga sell dope
I'mma slap your daddy out and then put him in a hole
Glock 40, whooo! Turn up, turn up
My ambitions as a rider!
Sippin' on lean, getting higher
Nigga I'm a codeine buyer
Know you
not a foreign whip driver
Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Bundles fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit'em in the head can you keep a solid?
Bulletproof whip we'll blow it up
Like some raw uncut don't blow it up
Represent your gang nigga throw it up
I don't give a fuck where you at nigga throw it up
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit
Shit,
shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit
Shit,
shit
Catch a nigga slippin' at the red light
With ya AK, let me see you shoot it
You a goon, you a goon, you a goon, you a goon
Nigga let me see you prove it
Presidential rollie and its glidin'
Love a nigga wrist when its shinin'
Hate a nigga wrist when its blingin'
So I went and added more diamonds
Hot boy nigga, BG
Thats the way these young niggas eat
Drinking on syrup can't sleep
Keep it copacetic with your partner
Blockbuster niggas running around with real choppers
Nigga what's the color of them bottles, they ain't gold
And you moving round with ya ho
You ain't even sticking to the code
Pimps up, pimps up, hoes down, hoes down
A pool full of money and I'm 'bout to drown
I'ma fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Button up suits at the Grammy's
Had to turn it up for the family
Yes I'm a Freebandz bandit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit
Shit,
shit
