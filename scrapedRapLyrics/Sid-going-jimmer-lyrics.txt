Jimmer getting interviewed on why he decided to take a half court shot first possession he got the ball, simply responds he had no idea how deep he was
I use to wear my cords in the winter, the way i take these shots you can call me jimmer
you just wanna be added on an like a affixation so fucking bad no thought of self desperation
Kinda like the thought of creation valuing that on fake foundations mixed with constant irradiation's
The book demands all these limitations just for you too get a little piece of salvation. open your eyes this is eradication same lines as fucking intoxication
I pull up and I'm shooting threes call it jimmer nation
You just like jimmer you always scoring threes and I'm not talking about basketball talking them ugly bitches u got on their knees and I'm talking oration bitch welcome to jimmer nation
I use to wear my cords in the winter, the way i take these shots you can call me jimmer
Versace everything and 3 years later still doing my damn thing
And dropping all 3s coming out of BYU with 32 bitches on they knees
Cords on my feet 24 is my high bitch I'm so elite
Fuck the heat play this shit again u got it on repeat
Sitting on the bench I might be discrete but when I'm on court I'm obsolete
Not talking bout chucks when I say I'm conserve and dispersing threes but I'm diverse like one of kanyes irrelevant outbursts
Looking like I'm flipping keys overseas but when really im fucking sick like my own disease
Never a been snake ion fuck with Burmese
But I saved the game in 2011 call me David freeze
Shouts out James Taft fredette. GOD
In game clip of announcers going crazy when jimmer hits half court shot mid game because he fuckin' can. bitch
