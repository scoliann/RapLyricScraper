Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking
Looking
Looking
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but Im still in the cut when they round up the troops
Im just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You dont have to try to say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
Its nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those the strings that you cant pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon really feel it now
Im out here
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge
[Beat switch]
All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my Os with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didnt say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But Im better off anyway, yall never gon finish Drake
Say you seeing bout it when you see me man yall never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldnt say
We even gave you the whole money play and y'all still broke to this day
Oh its your time now yeah, thats what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Yes pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what Im saying
Im that niggas what Im saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
Im not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six soon as Im back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave

Looking for revenge

Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
