[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I wanna be where the commas will be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then its dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
Cause it's levels to this shit,
and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston
You decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, baby
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new
Make that bad bitch my shorty
hit the club, throw forty
my chain drip like water
Car paint like tar,
Voom, voom, oh yeah,
big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years
On site, act right,
I shop hard, pack light
That ho chick gets you no play,
all I talk is cocaine
White tee and these rope chains
blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain
Phantom cost like four dollar
flo' seats, hoes holla
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur
Suffering From Success
You witnessing greatness..
I'm the best that ever did it
I wanna be with you
