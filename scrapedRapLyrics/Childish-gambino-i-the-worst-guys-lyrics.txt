All she needed was some... (x16)
At a Clippers game on the courtside
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five
They mad at me too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger" (Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate,
instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from?
We were playing Playstation
Why you standing there, say some, girl, say some
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house
[Hook]
[Extended Live Version,
Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You are the prototype
I love you like you love your photo likes
When you post your life
Some of these hoes just wanna Instagram me
You out here trying to win you an Instagrammy
Instant pancakes in the morning
Aunt Jemima try to Andre Benjamin me
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, but your daughter do dicks
Wouldn't be my old bitch if you taught her new tricks
But she do do the one thing, with her tongue ring
When she bust like a gun range
I had a couple pics, record her out her panties
But, that's just chump change
She the type of bitch that loves to say she's mixed
But when she say the roster she always say "Black last"
You know what it is and you know who it is
I love you with your black ass
Privileged thing
Everything that you did make everything
You, my mans did everything
All you needed was some

[Extended Live Version, Hook]
Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'm-a ball King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you want to play pool in my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a mnage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I-I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I-I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...
[Hook]
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
Our neighbors, all alone, no no no no
