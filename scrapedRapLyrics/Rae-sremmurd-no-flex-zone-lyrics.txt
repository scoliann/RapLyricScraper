(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter
Swae Lee, Lee Swae, it's the same difference
H2O, lean, same thing
Niggas throw sets and gangbang
Free everybody in the chain gang
It's been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee, five chains on
Mr. T, them rings on, say my fucking name, ho
Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine fo'
Never heard about you, all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me, nigga, trill-ass individual
Go and check on that nigga,
sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental,
got a L full of that killer
Beating on my chest like Magilla
Pack sound like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter
Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains, so they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, "Why you got so many condoms with you?"
I say, "I'm a player, to be honest with you"
Hublot, woo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's?
Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, wit' the loud, singing acapella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter
