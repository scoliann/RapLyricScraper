And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!
[Hook: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm comin' home again
(Min' home again)
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, lil homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat
Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up,
so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye, keep making that, keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm comin' home again
(Min' home again)
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her,
then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what we tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again
(Min' home again)
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again
[Outro: Chris Martin]
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Comin' home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Comin' home again
Maybe we can start again
