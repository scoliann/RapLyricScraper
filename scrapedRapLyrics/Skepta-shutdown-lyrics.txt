[Intro: Drake]
Man's never been in Marquee when it's shutdown eh? Trusss me daddi
(Man's never been in)
When it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown
Yeah, take time
If a man wanna try me, no time
Usain Bolt when I run up on stage
I pick up the mic and it's reload time
Don't know your songs but they know mine
That's why I got gigs just like Joe Grind
After the show I be rolling mine
Don't care bout the no smoking sign
They try to steal my vision
This ain't a culture, it's my religion
God knows I don't wanna go prison
But if a man wanna try me, trust me, listen
Me and my Gs ain't scared of police
We don't listen to no politician
Everybody on the same mission
We don't care about your -isms and schisms
Cause it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown
You wanna act like a G for the camera
You say you're Muslim, you say you're Rasta
Say you don't eat pork, don't eat pussy
Liar, you're just a actor
Blud, you're not on your deen
And if Selassie saw you he would say
"Blud take off the red gold and green"
Them man are soft just like ice cream
Seen? Start moving correctly
If you don't wanna upset me, you get me?
You tryna show me your Fendi
I told you before, this shit don't impress me
I bet I make you respect me
When you see the mandem are selling out Wembley
Roll deep in a blacked out Bentley
Pull up outside like "wah gwan sexy"
Yeah, and it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown
A bunch of young men all dressed in black dancing extremely aggressively on stage, it made me feel so intimidated and it's just not what I expect to see on prime time TV
I'm in a different class
When I get through I'mma bring my dargs
2 by 2, man a walk on the ark
Sittin' at the front, just like Rosa Parks
Trust me, you don't wanna see me get dark
Upset cause man are way up right now
And the shit happened all so fast
I was in Paris, shut down l'Arc
New York, shut down Central Park
Talk about London, yo Frisco where shall I start?
Walked in, spat ten 16 bars
And each and every one of them came from the heart
None of my lyrics are stolen
"Go on then, go on then", that's my slogan
Wanna know how I did it with no label
No A-list songs, and I told them
Blud, I just shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown
Link up Daddy
All right
Yo tomorrow I'm gonna come scoop you, we'll go to Biz's
Yeah for sure
All right
Dun know
