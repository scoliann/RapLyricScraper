The battle of Yorktown. 1781
[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton
[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette
In command where you belong
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field.
Weve had quite a run
[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants:

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done
So what happens if we win?
[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if Im given the chance

[HAMILTON]
Well be with you when you do
See you on the other side
Til we meet again, lets go!
I am not throwin away my shot!
I am not throwin away my shot!
Hey yo, Im just like my country, Im young
Scrappy and hungry
And Im not throwin away my shot!
I am not throwin away my shot!
[HAMILTON]
Til the world turns upside down

[ENSEMBLE]
Til the world turns upside down!
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me,
at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Elizas expecting me...
Not only that, my Elizas expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
Its either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is Rochambeau,
dig me?
Rochambeau!
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining bravry
Well never be free until we end slavery!
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside
Thats right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!
A tailor spyin on the British government!
I take their measurements, information
and then I smuggle it
Up
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
Im runnin with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin it!
See, thats what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan,
I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!
[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!
[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief
And just like that, its over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead
[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song theyre singing

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down
[FULL COMPANY]
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down
Freedom for America, freedom for France!
[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son
Down, down, down
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
We won!

[COMPANY]
The world turned upside down!
