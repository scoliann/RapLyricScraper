We move hard in these streets, young God, X'in' gthem O's
I'm like God in these streets, got a tech in my coat

Let it sit in your face like a dinner date
Then bust open your grill, let it ventilate
And my niggas is killers, what can I say?

And they peelin' bananas, no dinner plate
And I'm only gone ride with my syndicate
