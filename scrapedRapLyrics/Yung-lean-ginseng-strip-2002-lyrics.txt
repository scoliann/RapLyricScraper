2003
Arizona iced out boys
Yung Leandoer Shawty
Emotional boys 2001
Emotional shawtys in this bitch
Mackaveli
Bitches come and go (brah)
But you know I stay
Bitches come and go (brah)
But you know I stay
Got my balls licked by a Zooey Deschanel look-alike
Cocaine addict
razor blade to your head
Conflict, I'm a contradicted shit
Peeing on old people's houses is an inflict
2003 shit
this ain't no splitting bills shit
I'mma peel banana skids while listenin' to R Kelly's Greatest Hits
Yung Lean in the club for some morphine (morphine)
Yung Lean up in the club for some morphine (morphine)
Poppin' pills like zits
While someone vomits on your mosquito tits
Slitting wrists while dark evil spirits like Slitherin
Slitherin' with tricks
I'm sick, acid trip
Makes my spitting sick and makes me start hitting chicks, knitting thick
Shitting quick, fitting dick, like transmitting shit with an AIDS stick
Think you're gay as fuck like a fish stick
Tequila shots and salt licks
Getting balls in your face like a free kick
Yung Lean stays motherfucking freaky
(Bitch)
Rotten teeth like Gargamel
Cast a spell
You keep on trying to yell
But your dead body stinks worse than my swell
Well
Lean expels
Diagrams as if they were made in Excel
Fuck fat hoes like Adele
Get my dick stuck inside a lamp shell
Get it out with sperm cells and hair gel
Swim in Mexico,
mademoiselle
Point and laugh while he fell
Who's laughing now that I'm explosive like Alfred Nobel
Yung Lean only attracts an older clientele
Very well
Bitch
