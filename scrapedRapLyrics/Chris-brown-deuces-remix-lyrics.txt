[Chris Brown]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
Youll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up
[Drake]
What you mean I aint call you? I hit you when I landed
Im waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguing more and its getting less romantic
Yeah, I think shell be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
Ill fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
Im willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that youll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
Its useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside its killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didnt you think you would be over me
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind, again, again. and deuces I must throw ya peace
[Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, Imma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
Im stupid but I wont get my drama on
What Im dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout you know who I dont know who you talking 'bout
According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shits? you ain't gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better youd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better
[Chris Brown]
So you gonna diss me even though you know its wrong
Know you gonna
(miss me a little when Im gone)
Drizzy voice,
now Im ghost baby
Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
Im bout my business boys, plus I make paper
Come on that's old news, yesterdays paper
Oh, you talking, what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth
Youll never score another me, Ill shut it out
Act like theres gum in your hair girl, cut it out
Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag #red Louis belt
The farewell email from a female
But Im a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore,
but shes not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you cant ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if I was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have a good time
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
Its hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know its juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop making sad songs
[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her; to her
