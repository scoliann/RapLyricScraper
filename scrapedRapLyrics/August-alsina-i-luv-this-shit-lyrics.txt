It's 2 oclock and I'm faded
this kush feeling amazing
Got a voicemail on my phone
from a lil breezy feeling X-rated
She told a nigga she hurting
I'm in the car and I'm swerving
Man I stay on that Ciroc
man I stay taking shots
Man your girl be on my jock
maybe cause I'm everything you're not
See I ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga
I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
I'm way too high to be tripping like this
I'm way too young to be living like this
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So Imma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And I'mma keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And Imma keep on grinding cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fucking cause she luv this shit and I luv it
Rolling through my hood, rolling up some good
Shorty lips be rolling on the wood
Rolling over, I ain't sleeping over, now she, rolling the eye
Rolling on the floor laughing cause she looks so surprised
Girl, you been around the block
and I been on that Ciroc
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So Imma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And I'mma keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And Imma keep on grinding cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fucking cause she luv this shit and I luv it
you refuse to believe that my love is true
So I use all I got to prove to you
but the proof ain't enough so you move on
To the next dude like "What he gon do?"
Looking for a real nigga like in all the wrong places
And all the wrong ways, they don't care, they don't change cause
She gon' do what she want and that is okay
And he gon' do what he want and that is okay
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So Imma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And I'mma keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And Imma keep on grinding cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fucking cause she luv this shit and I luv it
