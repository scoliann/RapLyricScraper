[Verse 1: Ceza (Turkey)]
Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada diktafonuna tak
Kat kalem bir de ilham alnacak
Tam gaz choppers, havada dman avna kalm
Akalm, haydi bu battle' kazanalm
We started in the Midwest
Now we 'bout to take it all over the world, baby
This is the pinnacle, yeah, Tech N9ne
Follow me all around the planet
I run the gamut on Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with no apology
Pick 'em out the panic, a little manic, cause I gotta be
Frantic, Ima jam it, cause I'm an oddity
Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin' at Mama Nakas
I can pop at you proper
Cause Im partners with Waka Flocka
Give me the top of hip-hop
And watch him make 'em rock
with a show-stopper
Chakras popping off the (Worldwide Choppers)
If you anybody, you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle, not an identical soul is it
Loaded, cold as the polar get
Wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo, it exploded, the flow, behold it, cause when the motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a
Better you just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Give me the knock and Ima chop
He came and he went tomorrow
But Ima lock it down and hop in the pocket, like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up
I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trip when I rip it up
Sort of like I was liquored up and backing up in the gut
Everybody be knowing I be acting up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada, I be keeping the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man
The planet's unanimous
Can I cuss? Fuck anybody! Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust
Ain't nobody tough when I'm standing up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinking he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killing everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go
[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me
[Verse 3: J.L. (Kansas City)]
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developin'
Ain't gotta tell him it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
You're delicate, but loving every second of this
[Verse 4: U$o (Denmark)]
De vil alle tjekke nr vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smkker det, beatet jeg vkker det
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle "vild fucking chopper"
[Verse 5: Yelawolf (Alabama)]
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches, like I was playing Hamlet
Syllable burning,
that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peeling pecans
But instead, I'm peeling rappers' heads, making a sand-a-wich
Pick up a .22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread
Like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fucking beat
and I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne? Twist up the pine
And smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes
Well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
With an alien probe
[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me
or loosen the venom
And hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breaking them off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible
Makin' you nervous
You could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have
Because I'm an anomaly,
then I'ma give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwing it up in the air, takin' it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up, should've stayed home
My alien knowledge be making other astronomers'
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'ma be shining on them haters
I'm finna be using it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Don't even try to stop us
Cause we choppers and we worldwide,
and I'm
[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me
[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes (New York)]
See, now they ask when I'ma stop it, my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it
And when I'ma drop it, my dude
Inevitably, it's that I'ma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask What in the world is you proving
Wh-when you were already the best?
And What the hell is he doing?
Well, I'ma be choppin' and cuttin'
And breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
And fucking everything up 'til I make no further mistake and
Busting everything up,
like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
They loving everything until I got 'em stuttering-stupid
You hear 'em now?
D-d-d-d-dont do-do-do-do it
P-p-p-please, wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest
And now I'ma come and kill 'em
Get them, hit them, and finish them
And bang 'em in the head and diminish them
And then I'll hit 'em again at a minimum
Repeat it, coming to killing 'em
Then he be gotta be drilling them
Thinking They gotta be feeling him
Spitting lithium, see the way a nigga be spilling them
And getting them stupid
To the point where there's no forgiving him
Hoping you're listenin' and you're paying attention
And getting in the zone, I be flattening and packing in
nigga, now Im home
[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me
Im chopping em; call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killing 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any in a predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me
Whenever they mention me
Check my resume, they said the Gillgods biblical
[Verse 9: Twisted Insane (California)]
I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em
I bend 'em and send 'em and you can feel me
Digging up in your brain and bringing the pain
They often wanna kill me
Filling 'em with that fury
Get up and hurry, you can feel the real me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
And poppin' often, hit em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathin'
Youre fiendin' and dreamin' to find a demon
Name insane, Im a worldwide (Chopper)
