Young nigga, I got old cash, spazzing on they ass
I got Prada on my ho ass, got my last one mad
Pop a nigga like a damn tag, shopping on they ass
I just bought a new old Jag, yeah, it's so fast
Smoking flocka, you a jackass, all I smoke is gas
Don't you ask me where the poles at, where your clothes at?
I ain't talking 'bout my niggas damn it, but y'all tripping, too
Is it you? Damn, my nigga what the hell got into you?
Project Baby, y'all was skipping in the hallway, I was skipping school
On my Ps and Qs, on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleeding concrete, bet you niggas won't come cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you, so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissing on nobody beat, I'm vibing on the beat
Honestly, I'm just trying to be, I just gotta be
Trying to get over on anything, they telling lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't getting on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry boo, yeah I lie to you, but don't you lie to me
It's little Kodak, the finesse kid, boy who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you falling off your feet
I will trick your ass for a treat, call it Halloween
Yeah that money's what I play for, call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Mild with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me....
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You getting skinny, I'm getting chunky, getting money
Want some food? Boy you hungry, I want them hundreds
