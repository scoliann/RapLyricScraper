What's the difference between me and you?
Back when Cube was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils
Got down to business
but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cause you my nigga Doc
Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you and that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they [voice sample]
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
I act on what I feel
never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting
Yo I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick (yeah)
shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catching feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
(c'mon)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you (what)
About five bank accounts
Three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference
[Hook: Phish]

[Eminem]
Aight, hold up, hold up
Stop the beat a minute!
I got somethin' to say
Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fucking weed is in me
(What the fuck)
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfucking back (right) just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one
nigga
I mean it dawg
You ever need somebody offed
Whose throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people, (hi)
then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off,
drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub
'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream "I just don't give a fuck!" and see who means it
[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
I act on what I feel
never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting
