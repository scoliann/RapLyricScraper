Tell me where you wanna go

Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you
She independent, you be ballin' on the budget
She ridin' in the fly's all the real niggas love it
Money making mission she just steady chasin' duckets
Shawty, she ain't playin' she just ballin', Denver Nugget
[Hook]

Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you
Baby, just be comfortable

Cause I know that she be workin'
In the spare time shawty just countin' dough
[Hook]
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable

Remy all wet falling right down your spine
I ain't tryna front I just want it from behind
[Hook]
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
