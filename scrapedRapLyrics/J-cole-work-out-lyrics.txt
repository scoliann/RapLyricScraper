Straight up, now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever? (oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit and run?
(I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me)
Ay, we've got a good thing
Dont know if Imma see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl, I cant be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hope it never would end
Like, "is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand?"
Well then
Let me see you get
High then go low
Now, girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
Im here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (work out for me, work out for me)
She like them boys with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old Range
I knew her when I rocked big old jeans
Now the little nigga doing big old thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: "baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there"
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year,
that's unfair, but
So is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money cant buy you love cause its overpriced
Dont overthink, just hope it's right
Im only here for the night
Ay, we've got a good thing
Dont know if Imma see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl, I cant be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hope it never would end
Like, "is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand?"
Well then
Let me see you get
High then go low
Now, girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
Im here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (work out for me, work out for me)
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block,
damn, girl you're mean
They be starting shit, but its your world
On my Martin shit: "You go, girl!"
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, Im not that heroic
Could you be my escort? Cause just like them 2-door Fords
Damn, they dont make them like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool, me? Im on fire
Know what's on my mind, trying to see what's on yours
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass
Get right, get right
Ay, we've got a good thing
Dont know if Imma see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl, I cant be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hope it never would end
Like, "is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand?"
Well then
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever? (oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit and run?
Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (oh oh oh)
Come here girl, let's get it on
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever? (oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit and run?
Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (oh oh oh)
Come here girl, let's get it on
