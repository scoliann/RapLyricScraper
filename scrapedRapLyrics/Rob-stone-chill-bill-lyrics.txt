Rob $tone two damn phones
Babylons can't crack the code
Used to sip out styrofoam but figured I should stick to dro (weed!)
Backwoods overload don't like to smoke them swishers hoe
If you hit my liquor store it's 50 cents for single Ports
Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said baby just buy dutches cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud but no money babe buy me a Fiji
She said you need a job, bitch fuck a job I still get cheese
[Verse 2: J. Davi$]
Twelve o seven fuck an op
Im sippin water out the Voss
Mr. Kenny Powers bouta take your girlfriend home tonight, bitch
[Verse 3: Spooks]
And I'm smokin' on that widow
When you see it out the window
Growin' up I was always in the middle
So I gotta hold it down for my older and my little
But I be in LG
Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said baby just buy dutches cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud but no money babe buy me a Fiji
She said you need a job, bitch fuck a job I still get cheese
