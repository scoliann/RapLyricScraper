I like smoking weed, I like getting fly
I like having sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turning up
I like brand new shit so this is what I love the most
I like that money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Gotta have that money baby, money baby, money baby
Thats that shit I like (oh, oh)
I like taking niggas hoes but I stopped doing that
Once I hit her with that dick she don't know how to act
Blowing up a niggas phone can you please fall back
Aye lil ho leave me alone, I ain't got time for that
I like good weed, I like bad bitches that can roll it up
And a rider that's gon hold me down no matter what (stay down)
Sipping good so please don't worry bout what's in my cup (its not yours)
And she on them drugs so yeah you know she down to fuck
It's going down, it's going down, it's going down, lil bitch
I'm known to stay one hundred and you counterfeit (I can't fuck with you)
And you ain't with my crew if you ain't tryna get rich (gotta run that up)
And I'ma dick her down, yeah she love that shit
I like chilling with your bitch and I like fucking her (like fucking her)
First time she catch a feeling then she fuck it up (she fuckin up)
And I ain't the police so I ain't cuffing her (ain't cuffing her)
And I like buying the whole pound just to burn it up (hol up)
Let-let-let me in, let-let-let me in
Let me smash you and your friend, I'm tryna go in girl
She like popping mollies, she like sucking dick (she like sucking dick)
She want a Instagram but I ain't with that shit
In-in-in-in her hotter than a chinchilla
And I stay flexing on a bitch nigga (bitch nigga)
And I stay dressing like a rich nigga
Don't watch me, you better watch yo bitch nigga
