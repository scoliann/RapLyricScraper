Persian Rugs, but she's from Nicaragua
Are we turning up
Or are we wasting time?
Girl, don't waste my time
You know I'm Party
I don't just wanna chill with you
Oh no
I wanna turn up on
I wanna turn you on
I wanna lay with you
That's the least I'ma do (ooohhh)
Fuck I look like?
I don't wanna chill...
I'm kissing ya, I want you to feel
Can you feel it baby?
Can you feel me baby?
Can you feel it baby?
Can you feel me baby?
Kissing you there
Fucking you right
Loving you there
Loving you right
Fuck with a pro
Come baby, fuck with a pro
When you gon' let me know?
I be kissing you slow
Tongue down, down, down, down
I'll be down, down, down, down
But youre mine, and I make you feel right
The way I'm talking girl, Ima focus all night
Ooh no no no
Make love to you
What am I doing
