I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco
Hit my plug, that's my cholo (mi amigo)
Cause he got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco (go crazy)
Hit you with that treinta ocho
Niggas thinkin' that I'm solo
Fifty deep, they like, "oh, no"
Heard the feds takin' photos
I know nothin', fuck the popo
[Refrain]
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco
Thirty six, that's a kilo (aqui)
Need a brick, miss my free throw (they white)
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' shots, now he Neo (Matrix)
Free my homies, fuck the C.O (puto)
Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O (puto)
All this coke, like I'm Nino
Water whip, like I'm Nemo
[Refrain]
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low, low
I'm in love with the coco
