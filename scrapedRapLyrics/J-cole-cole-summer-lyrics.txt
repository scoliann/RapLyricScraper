This right here is not a preview
I need to let it go, yeah
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nothing like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve,
and I, bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!", Ms. Hill please don't sue me
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he's throwing fifty
Lord, forgive me
Bitches saying: "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'pose to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'pose to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job,
but hold your horses
If my next album flops it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...
Anticipating rain,
I can't make the same mistakes again
Them 90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma
Cause really I am just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
Cause I'm finta, drop knowledge like a five percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg,
nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met 'pac and said "I'm down with ya!"
And when they wasn't writing rhymes they fucking lined sisters
Puffin' on swishers,
what's up Milan?
Everytime I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded
Let me switch it now,
back to Hell's kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dumbies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets, but nigga that ain't really where they were
Acting just like there they were, but who am I to judge?
That's neither here or there
Just know I know, my nigga,
I just like being aware
If i had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera, at the same time
And put name tags on they titties so I dont get they name wrong
Screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now
5 days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from sampling now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June will make four years since I gave you my number
"The Warm Up" dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas,
I dropped "Friday Night Lights" in the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer
But the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me
I can't let it go
June 25th. Born Sinner. Bitch
