[Intro: Eminem]
Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
And gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes
Reggie,
Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast,
Jada,
Kurupt,
Nas,
and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around
Like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney;
Nate, hit me
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts
I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic,
I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps,
who want some static?
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
[Outro: Eminem (Nate Dogg)]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from (underneath me)
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me
