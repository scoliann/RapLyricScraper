Yeah, mothafuckas better know
I'm a bad bad bad
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls
My man Inf left a Tec and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a
bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper,
G
Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
vest
No need for that,
gat
The first pocket that's fat,
the Tec is to his back
Word is bond,
yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip
.45
Two point blank,
a motherfucker sure to die
nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, it's so hard
Yes love,
love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block
and I'm robbing bitches too
herringbones
bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal,
Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother
I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack,
where the paper at?
When he's sticking you and taking all of your money
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Big up, big up,
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace,
sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent
stash
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
(yeah nigga, peel)
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta,
putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches
colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets
motherfuckas can't stop it
Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled
earrings and bangles
doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
So go get your man bitch, he can get robbed too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it
Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch
Ooh money looks sweet
[Young Biggie]
In the
Isuzu jeep
Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Ooh Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat
Yo chill shorty
let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
Oh shit the cops
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up,
all they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking?
tooken
I just came home,
central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucka going out for the loot
Take that motherfuckers
