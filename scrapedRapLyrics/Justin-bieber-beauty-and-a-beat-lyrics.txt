Yeah, Young Money, Nicki Minaj, Justin
What you got, a billion could've never bought (ooohh)
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I want to show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete (oohhh)
Body rock (yeah yeah) girl, I wanna feel your body rock (oohh oohh)
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I want to show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete(oowwoooh)
In time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, it's mine, ten little letters on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know I'mma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selener
Beauty, beauty and the beast
Beauty from the East,
beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets
beat will get deceased
Every time Beauty on the beat
Body rock, girl, I wanna feel your body rock
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go)
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
