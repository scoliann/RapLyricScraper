This shit is highly sophisticated
I just make it look easy, nigga
Follow me
[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Im so sophisticated
To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
Im from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated
Just bought a chopper cause the last one, got it confiscated
Counting a hundred mil so many times, I contemplate it
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know youre pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe youll have to kill me for that combination
Made another two milli just off the compilation
I just hit a lick, Im telling you this shit amazing
Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican
Sipping purple and that motherfucker concentrated
This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like its Walter Payton
The game sweet,
gave all my niggas an occupation
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it (Ugh!)
Smoking weed, busting open Dom and liquor later
I bust her open then I tell her Imma lick her later
Pull out the stick and spray that bitch just like its activator
Time to lay down these niggas who still be masquerading
We know you pussies, so you got my niggas masturbating
Round of applause cause them choppers be so captivating
So sophisticated cause them hits be calculated
Put yo dick in the dirt, now you decapitated
Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli (Babyyy)
Im the hottest and these other niggas cooling, aint it
I got a bitch Im fucking that you see on BET
My Lil Haiti shooters will have yo ass on TMZ
Breaking news and we still get them for ten a key
tell them niggas Cest la vie
Shitting on these haters, ball hard D Waiters
Ever since I got money, erybody need favors
Thats why I aint got no homies, and I aint got no neighbors
But I be on my grind like I aint got no paper
But Im so rich and I got yo bitch
All in my whip and she all on my dick
With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib
Cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit
Cause I burn shit down, yeah I'm in my bag
And these niggas so mad its my turn now
And I get that cash and my bitch so bad, she so sophisticated
My neck so frosty, you frauding, yo shit refrigerator
Boy you an imitator
You aint got no Ms in yo account, I never ask my amount
Treat that bad bitch like a bad check cause I cash that and I bounce
I aint never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce
And I flipped that to a bird and bounced back like word
