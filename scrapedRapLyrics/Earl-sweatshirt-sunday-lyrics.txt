[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into, and I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you, I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
, and this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the Logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded I stumble
To where she park when she visit
I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
She, she seems that
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Im coming back I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat,
left you at terminal three
Ill meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
And you parade my homecoming, dont cry
You know I cant live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But Id be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please
Palm, no marijuana, trees
Your hickies on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When Im playing surfboarder,
put whisky in that salt water
I emptied every canteen just to wear that straight edge varsity you thinks cool
They thought me soft in High School, thank God Im jagged
Forgot you dont like it rough, I mean he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean how anal am I gon' be when Im aiming my gun
And whys his mug all bloody, that was a three on one?
Standing ovation at Staples I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit,
Im not supposed to be stunting
Its all melodic this song, I catch this vibe in my sleep
But Im just jet-lagged is all, and restless
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I start smoking pot
Loving yous a little different I dont like you a lot
I meanfuck
I dont know what were about
What good is West Coast weather if youre bi-polar?
If I'mma need this sweater, Id rather be where its cold
Where it snows,
I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, know theyre coming in droves
Youll only miss when it goes
(Yeah, I think thats it)
