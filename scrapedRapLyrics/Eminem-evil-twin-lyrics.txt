Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred
[Verse 1]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is baste
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you - aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
For battles sucka - duck, crawl out the back
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air and bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut
But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)"
Oh, my bad. Slut
And next time I show up to court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You're so fucking gravy, Marshall I should start calling you 'au jus'
Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
Cause they're worse when they're reversed motherfucker
(Rape your mother, kill your parents)
[shit, motherfucker]
And these kids are like parrots, they run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming, "fuck, shit, fuck"
adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like, merits
Fuck that - I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics
Dreamy eyes",
but my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite,
sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition (ha ha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
[Bridge]
There's darkness closing in, there it goes again
It controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend, who pops up now and again
So don't blame me, just blame him, it's my evil twin
(I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time
[Verse 2]
So who's left,
Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba,
my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burning to death but I'm freezing
Bed ridden
and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker,
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit bitch,
Give up my dick for pussy?
I'd be Jerry Mathers, I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally,
I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden,
it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun
At Osborn,
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping,
I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in it's tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming "Fuck the police" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an Evil Twin
So who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass
Like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
Cause I'm so sick of being the truth, I wish someone finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh LMFAO,
no way, Jo-
Se Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony,
(hey ho) Hey-ho!
I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray",
no
Im hollering you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
Let your low end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing or bowling?
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm looking for romance cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a bo-ner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
Cause we are the same, bitch
