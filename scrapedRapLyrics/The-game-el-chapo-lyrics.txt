Granada, I'm falling under your spell
I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
You know I get the kilos, cincuenta porciento
If you are not bilingual
Get the fuck up out of town, 'fore we run your ass down
Underground how I came out
Any nigga try to stop me let it hang out, let it bang, let it rain out
Yo soy el dios you adios nigga (I am the God)
Seen a nigga chopped up on a Tuesday
While the club goin' up on a Tuesday
This is doomsday, I can have Guadalupe
Come through and knock Donald Trump out his toupee
Now look at his brains all on the sidewalk
And tuck the .38 and jump on my skywalker
And whew, I'm rollin'
Shotgun, Claudia, oh Shotgun (I am the God)
Only nigga walking through Sinaloa with the blood
Red Chuck Taylors on and you know it when I show up
It's a squad full of killers, squad full of hittas
Squad full of niggas that'll pull up, let it bark on a nigga
Hundred six shots bark on a nigga
Street sweeper wet the whole block up, Noah's Ark on a nigga
Got two Glock 9s, two .45s, two Desert Eagles
And they fly together side by side
No juego conmigo, tu sabes de mi
No Tony Montana, mis amigos mis kilos
Mi casa, su casa cuidado con el chico
Tu quieres la plata yo tengo perico
(Ya te dije el juego y fuego paisa)
I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
Pinches policas (Puto)
Jodiendo todo el da (Cabrn)
Que si ora tu familia
O mi madre y mi ta, I see
I'm on a private jet with El Chapo, feet up
Sippin' Tecate bout to land for the re-up
Fuck the Montanas, we ain't got them trackin' devices
The feds they be watchin' and see us
Niggas wanna see us? Check the IG
I'm in the Villa throwin' blood up like an IV
Don't try me, DeJ Loaf with the AK
600 million, 400 million from Dre Day, uh
Pablo Escobar in my hey-day, uh
Bringing off coke that's a payday, uh
On a private jet that's a mayday, uh
In South America on a vacay, uh
P on my snapback, choppin' grade-a, uh
None of these niggas ready for the melee, uh
Hundred cal make his body do the nae nae
Leave a nigga face worse off than Sheneneh
I am the God, I've been tellin' you niggas
I got a bird and a chopper in the trunk
Ven aqui I will sell it to niggas
We can screw it and chop it
Machetes on deck, I will sever you niggas
Behind these bars I'm El Chapo
Motorcycle out the cell on you niggas
Escchame chingatumadre, nunca me encontrars
So para de mirar, no me controlas, te controlo
Controlo a todos me respetan o se mueren
Soy el Chapo y la hago en Sinaloa
I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, nigga, I am the God
Nigga, I am the God
