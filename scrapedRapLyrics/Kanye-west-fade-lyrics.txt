[Intro: Rare Earth]
Your love is fadin'
Your love is fadin'
Your love is fadin'
I feel it's fadin'
When no one ain't around (I feel it's fadin')
I think I think too much (I feel it's fadin')
Ain't nobody watchin' (I feel it's fadin')
I just fade away
I feel it
Fade away
I feel it
I feel it
Fade away-ay-ay-ay
I think I think too much
I feel it
Your love is fadin'
I feel it
Roll up, roll up; hold up, hold up; po' up, po' up
I feel it
I feel it
I'ma rock the boat, work the middle 'til it hurt a little
I feel it
Your love is fadin'
I feel
Fuckin' with a real ass nigga
I feel it
Fuck how you feel ass nigga
I feel it
Bitch better act like you know better
I feel it
Woah
When no one ain't around (I feel it's fadin')
I think I think too much (I feel it's fadin')
Ain't nobody watchin' (I feel it's fadin')
I just fade away (I feel it's fadin')
[Verse 2: Post Malone + Rare Earth]
You don't even know, I've been so far gone (I feel it)
I've been so led on, I've been runnin' 'round (I feel it)
I've been on my shit, whole world on my dick (I feel it)
I just need to know (I can feel it)
