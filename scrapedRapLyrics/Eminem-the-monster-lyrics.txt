I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see,
but it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep; one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, cause I'm
[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, thats nothin'
Well, thats nothin'
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head,
keep knocking
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, thats nothin'
Well, thats nothin'
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed, and
I'm coming straight at MCs, blood gets spilled, and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
pumped up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it, and
Relates, that's great,
it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can
Make that,
straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, thats nothin'
Well, thats nothin'
