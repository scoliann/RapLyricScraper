[BURR]
How does a
bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman,
dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean
by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter
[JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain
Well, the word got around, they said, This kid is insane, man
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
Get your education, dont forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. Whats your name, man?
[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And theres a million things I havent done
But just you wait, just you wait...
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick
And Alex got better but his mother went quick
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
You gotta fend for yourself.
Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.
He started retreatin and readin every treatise on the shelf
There would have been nothin left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin, clerkin for
his late mothers landlord
Tradin sugar cane and rum and all the things he cant afford
Scammin for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin for the future
see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can
Be a new man
In New York you can
Be a new man
In New York you can be a new man
Just you wait!
Alexander Hamilton

We are waiting in the wings for you
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Another immigrant
Comin up from the bottom
His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him
Alexander Hamilton

Waiting in the wings for you
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
Alexander Hamilton
America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh
[MULLIGAN/MADISON & LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON]
We fought with him
[LAURENS/PHILIP]
Me? I died for him
[WASHINGTON]
Me? I trusted him
[ELIZA & ANGELICA & PEGGY/MARIA]
Me? I loved him
[BURR]
And me?
Im the damn fool that shot him
Alexander Hamilton!
