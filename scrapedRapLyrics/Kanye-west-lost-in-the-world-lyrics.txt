[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still, down the time
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
(I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind)
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
(I'm building a still, to slow down the time)
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night
Slow down the time
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
(I'm up in the woods)
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
(I'm building a still)
Down for the night
Down for the night
[Verse: Kanye West]
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma ma se, ma ma se, ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms, still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms, still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
(Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
(Run for your life, down for the night)
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
(Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
(Run for your life, down for the night)
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
