Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when
But it was gon' end up happening, I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive, and put me after Em
I'm a fucking genius
Gripping my fucking penis,
living this life
You can't tell me nothing
Still ain't really got no money, fucking right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers
Put two chains on, and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild, too damn proud
Been killing this since Cam made "Oh Boy"
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE,
put the money in my hand, ain't shit free
This business is quick sand
and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say
When I wanna say it, okay then
Furthermore, we do this for y'all
Rap is stressing, but it pays great
That is, until you lose appeal
And your release date gets date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fish and a loaf of bread
Feed the people food for thought
Cause we all equal, who'd have thought?
[Hook: Ab-Soul] (Kendrick)
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)
I used to wanna rap like Jay Z
Now I feel I could run laps 'round Jay Z
Nas ain't seen nothing this nasty
BIG and Pac got it coming when I pass, too
You got the mic? I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed
HiiiPower on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Poppin' Compton or
Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words
True eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch
When you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though,
like coal get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes,
on P's,
y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty
The best author ever to breathe
And as we proceed to follow these dreams
I ain't losing no sleep
No, no on them NoDoz,
just know "No" if it's no dough
So high, but I'm Soulo;
two cups and I sip slow
Taking my time,
we don't just shine
We illuminate the whole show,
now let's go!
[Hook: Ab-Soul] (Kendrick)
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time, I drop line for line,
but only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop thirty 9's and cock back and kill
See, the truth is
They wanna know how close me, Dre and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this to beat 2Pac
But truth, I give two shits 'bout expectations or critics hatin'
Shit, I just put Moms on vacation
Bitch, you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the mothafuckin' King dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness,
the Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinte Kunta
Black is back, bitch,
I'm kin to Kunta
Black on black crime resent the shooter
Blat-blat-blat!
I intend to mute ya
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks without my A-game
So please don't ask me about no pressure, bitch
With the grip of my fingertip, I can hold this coast together
[Hook: Ab-Soul] (Kendrick)
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)
