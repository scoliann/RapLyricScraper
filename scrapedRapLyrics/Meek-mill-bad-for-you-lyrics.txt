You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad
And they say bad girls ain't no good
Good girls ain't no fun
I still can't find a nigga that touch that
I don't know one
And I ain't searching for it
Never trust but I'm working on it
Fell in love with that ride game
Swimming pool, you surfing on it
Like 'Yonce, do the surfboard, surfboard
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work, twerk
Do it like that video
Wanted that for a long time
Cool with it, I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know
How could something that's so wrong feel so right?
But who to tell you this wrong, though? This your life
Word up
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad
We just fucking up the city, going hard every night
Niggas hating on us, you know lord they ain't right
Cause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
But you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
So they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect
I'm loving your style the way you preserve it
Just look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know that it's pride, you say that I'm worth it
But said I ain't ready, really I'm ready
Really I'm ready, I'm ready like never before
I'mma just give you a key to my heart
You'll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you was hearing about me and the women
Ain't trust them before
You know what you're doing, fuck what they said
You know what we on
When we in bed, it's like we on stage
And I got the mic so let me perform, sing it
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad
