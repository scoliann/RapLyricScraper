Caroline
See, Caroline, all the guys would say she's mighty fine
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cussed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, even though
You'd need a golden calculator to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, haha, yeah
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see that roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see that roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Caroline, see she's the reason for the word bitch (BITCH)
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror and crash, crash, crash
Into a ditch
Just playing
She needs a golden calculator to divide
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah
[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped,
dropping names she's weak
must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasing cars
What happens when the dough gets low
Bitch, you ain't that fine, no way, no way, no way
Crazy bitch
(Bitch, stupid ass bitch, old punk-ass bitch
Old dumb-ass bitch, a bitch's bitch, just a bitch)
