[Intro]
Turn my headphones up, louder
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, hello white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon' act phony, or who gone try to embarrass ya
I'mma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
(Bueller had a Muller
but I switched it for a Mille
Cause Im richer and prior to this shit was moving free base)
Had a conference with the DJs, Puerto Rico three days
(Poli with the PDs now they got our shit on replay)
Sorry Im in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
(Aint that where the Heat play? Niggas hate ballas these days) Yep!
Aint that like Lebron James? (Aint that just like D. Wade? Wait)
Wussup, wussup, wussup, wussup
Wussup muh'fucka where my money at?
You gon make me come down to your house where yo mommy at
Mummywrap the kids, have em cryin for they mommy back
Dummy that your daddy is, tell 'em I just want my racks
(Racks on racks on racks) Racks!
(Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs)
Who in that?
(Oh shit, its just blacks on blacks on blacks)
(Hundred stack) How you get it? (Nigga layin raps on tracks)
I wish I could give you this feeling, Im planking on a million
Im riding through yo hood, you can bank I aint got no ceiling
(Made a left on Nostrand Ave., we in Bed Stuy)
Made a right on 79th, Im coming down South Shore Drive
(I remain Chi-town)
Brooklyn til I die
[Outro: James Brown]
Take em on home, take em on home
I got what you need, what, what you need
Tryna hurt my name, huh?
