[Intro]
Nigga, turn up
It's GuWop
Trap house bunkin'
Trap house mansion
Yeah, right on Flat Shoals Exit, nigga
We got landing on a train
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm pourin' fours and shit, I need to just put a deuce in
Car cost four-hundred-thou' and I put a roof in
My nigga pot cook it so good he put his shoe in
Nigga, it's a gangsta party, why fuck is you in?
Head bust a microwave, shit, didn't take him two minutes
You know that there's some straps in the club, they let my crew in
I might just do the Michael Vick man and cook it left hand
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man
I can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon
I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman
If Gucci Mane got so much money then why he robbin'?
We thirty deep, we come from the streets, nigga, we mobbin'
(It's Guwop), again
Thugger and Guwop, again
Chasin' that Guwop, again
That's my lil whoadie, again
We chasin that money baby, again
We fuckin' your hoe up baby, again
Pull up and pour it
I'mma go gold, let you know it
I got gold on my rollie
And I'm real right like a poet
I look like a dope boy, I know it
I know I'm gonna win it like Floyd
I became an important lil' boy
Money long like a sock with some shorts
My bitch white and she brown like port
Ed-umacation abort, bookin' these dorks
I jumped off the porch and went north
Whipped you some dope full of narc-cotics
YSL hardbody
,
I got 'bout 20 chickens in the lobby, baby
Ride It, ride It Kawasaki, saki
I don't speak english
I fuck that mouth, on the secret
I'm the big homie, I'm leakin'
Stick to the streets like I'm cement
I don't need no change, you can keep it
I don't want your verse on my remix
No panties she my secret
Got a hunnid bands on me I'm cheesin'
This the sequel, lookin' down like an eagle
(It's Guwop), again
Thugger and Guwop, again
Chasin' that Guwop, again
That's my lil whoadie, again
We chasin that money baby, again
We fuckin' your hoe, again
Pull up and pour it
I'mma go gold, let you know it
I got gold on my rollie
And I'm real right like a poet
I know I'm gonna win it like Floyd
I became an important lil' boy
Money long like a sock with some shorts
