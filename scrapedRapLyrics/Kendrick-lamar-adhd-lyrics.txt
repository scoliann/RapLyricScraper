Uh-uh, fuck that (Fuck that)
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case,
nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight,
nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance
when your age don't exist
[Verse 1]
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
Playstation and some drank
(Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black,
she black too
Purple label on her back,
but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case,
nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight,
nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance
when your age don't exist
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D. did it)
[Verse 2]
And then she started...
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon?"
"Oh, I rap, baby"
"How old are you?",
She say, "22", I say, "23"
"Okay, then we are crack babies"
"Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later
Just tell your neighbors that the police relaxed"
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, "Read between the lines"
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown
Her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
Then she grabbed it,
then she said, "Get it understood"
"You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s,
that A.D.H.D. crazy"
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case,
nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight,
nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance
when your age don't exist
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D. did it)
[Outro: Ab-Soul]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup,
deuce, four, six,
just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
