[Intro]
That smile on your face
Makes it easy to trust you
Those in
Those in
Those in
Those in
This what 'Sauga feels like in the night time
Watch what she doin' when the light shine
Drunk niggas tryna talk in the strip club
Shawty silhouette looks like a dolla sign
Caught up (caught up)
Thats just how a nigga brought up (brought up)
Blow ones for you loonie ass niggas
Straight bills for you toonie ass niggas
My niggas bigger then the bouncer
Roll up in the bitch still smell like an ounce
Tight jeans on so she feels my shit
Tell me something good baby
Tell me something, Tell me something good shawty
Come bring it to the hood baby
Bring it, bring it back to hood
This what Sauga feels like in the night time
Bust it open, shawty when the light shine
Still fuckin with the same ass niggas
I know you want a break
I know you want a break from Toronto
West side
