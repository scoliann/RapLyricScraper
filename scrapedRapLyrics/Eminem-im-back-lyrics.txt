That's why they call me Slim Shady
(I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back)
I'm back
(Slim Shady)
I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waiting for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson,
you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success?
It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess,
I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no)
was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say hi
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-
-T-E,
cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now
That's why they call me Slim Shady
(I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back)
I'm back
(Slim Shady)
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
{*vocal scratches*} My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational
{*vocal scratch "Back is the incredible!"*}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
"Slim, for pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted,
I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doing lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hopping out, all high and indo scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me
That's why they call me Slim Shady
(I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back)
I'm back
(Slim Shady)
I take seven [kids] from [Columbine], stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHH)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother
I'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?
Guess who's b-back, back
(hi, mom)
D-12
Dr. Dre
Slim Shady,
2001
I'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck
