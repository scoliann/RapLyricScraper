[Prod. by Ricky Reed]
I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap, girl, riding comfortable
Cause I know what da girl dem need
New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, make it hard to leave
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on me
You know the words to my songs, no habla Ingls
Our conversations ain't long, but you know what is
I know what the girl dem want
London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, I think I need a new one
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on me
Uno: met a friend in Rio
Dos: she was all on me-o
Tres: we could mnage  three-o
Cuatro:
[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Dos Cadenas, close to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck
Chest to chest, tongue on neck
International oral sex
Every picture I take, I pose a threat
Bought a jet, what do you expect?
Her pussy so good I bought her a pet
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is when you
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on me
