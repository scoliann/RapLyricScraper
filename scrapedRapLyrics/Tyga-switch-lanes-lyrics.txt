When I switch lanes, phantom doors swing
Arm out the window screaming money ain't a thang
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Rari switch lanes, diamonds in my chain
Been around the world all the hoes know my name
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Mr. automatic bang, bang, bang
Fuck a nigga up
louie belt match the chucks
I'm in the club with raw nigga, 10 ratchets tucked
Back it up like a u-haul
when cash is up
Spades in my ice bucket, rub that for luck
Racks in my cargos, Audemar stupid
Bitch say she in love with me, stay away from cupid
The Panamera's sick, Lupus
T-Rawwwww show them how we do it
Swoosh sign, do it
, my new bitch
A nudist, peace like a buddist
Cooler than cool-whip, give brain don't be stupid
Faded like boozy
cut like a crew neck
another check, another rolex
Mo' less, the moet, the mo' sex, I must say
I boarded the P-Jet, more than a piss test
So I wake up, I'm fucked up
my ex tryna' make up
Break up, telling these bitches to get their cake up
Wake Up, shooting my babies all on her make up
I'm running through all these hoes, Brandon Jacobs
Lambo doors up, sitting just like her legs
Never tell a bitch I love her
Money talk Chris Tucker
Got a chauffeur, and a driver
I don't lease it, I'mma buy it
I'll be on the broke diet
You ain't eating, but you biting my style
Motherfucking strike like lightning
T-Carti
my bitch like Bvlgari
I walk in the spot, all these bitches bogart me
Spent 30 racks, I'mma make it back tomorrow
Pull up with a big titty bitch like Toccara
You ain't never seen a rari, look like a safari
Tyga riding shotgun
snake print Cartier
I'm in them Nike Airs
2500 nigga call them Nikes rare
See them niggas hating, but I don't really care
Gold bottles coming, tell them bitches light flares
Snow on my wirst call that rollie big bear
See it in the light though (woooo!) Ric Flair
Pull up at the barber shop, chop off the top of the Phantom
Bitches screaming A, we ain't where near Atlanta
Maybe she a rockstar, maybe she a sinner
Fucking with them lottery balls, now she a winner
I'm all in that Virginia, I mean that vagina
Get lost in that pussy, nigga you will never find me
Eat it like lasagna, eat it like E-Honda
Shout out my nigga Breezy and beat it like Rihanna
