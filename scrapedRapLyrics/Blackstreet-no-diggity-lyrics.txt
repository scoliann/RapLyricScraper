I like the playettes
Verse 1: Dr. Dre
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
bump like acne
No doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides,
[Refrain x4]
I like the way you work it
No diggity
I got to bag it up, bag it up
Catchin' feelings is a no
Herb's the word,
spin's the verb
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
Trump tight
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh
Verse 4: Queen Pen
What you know about me? Not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooden frames
sported by my shorty
As for me
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
playette's
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
[Refrain x4]
