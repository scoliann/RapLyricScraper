[Hook 1 - Dej Loaf]
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like
She be tellin' me what to do cause she think she the boss
We don't never trip much, we be shakin' it off
Win, lose, or draw, I back against the wall
I'm willing to grow, cause I've wanted it all
I'm one of a kind, she one of them dimes
Been at it for a while, we puttin' in time
I'm lovin' her thoughts, she changing my mind
We learnin' together
the stars align
Fly face, nice body, and swag crazy
She work and she goin' to school, she ain't lazy
And when she out and about, she look wavy
And when they try to ask what's up, she say Casey
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like
Whatever you like whatever you like whatever you like (she'll do whatever I like)
Whatever you like whatever you like whatever you like (she'll do whatever I like) (she'll do whatever I like)
Take a gold shot with me
But she the one that's gone ride with me
We cruise through the hood, end up in Beverly Hills
We talked about how the lime light was never that real
She asked me questions about her sex, like how does it feel
Shorty you're the best, I'm just keepin' it real
Let them know you run shit in advance
Back it up on em' yeah, do your dance
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like
