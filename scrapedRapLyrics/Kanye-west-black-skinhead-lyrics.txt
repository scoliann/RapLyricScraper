For my theme song (black)
My leather black jeans on (black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom (black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (black)
Came to see me in my black skin (black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
Stop all that coon shit (black)
Early morning cartoon shit (black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch (black)
Black out the room, bitch (black)
Stop all that coon shit (black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
