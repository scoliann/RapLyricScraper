[Intro]
Metro Boomin want some more nigga
[Hook: Jeremih]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it, want-want-want some more
(Still want some more) Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they (want some more)
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it cause I (want some more)
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they (want some more)
(Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more)
I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade, like it's sunny
Who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, "She a problem?"
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?
Who made Lil Wayne, give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it? Oh, you niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown, on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas (Oh!)
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z and Diddy!
[Hook: Jeremih]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it, want-want-want some more
(Still want some more) Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they (want some more)
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it cause I (want some more)
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they (want some more)
(Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more)
(Yo, yo)
I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said thank you
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B'Day
These bitches suck, so I Nick', name (nick-name) these bitches BJ
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho, just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch, my name Barbie, bitch
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash money, getting six albums,
no bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem
[Hook: Jeremih]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it, want-want-want some more
(Still want some more) Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they (want some more)
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it cause I (want some more)
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they (want some more)
(Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more)
