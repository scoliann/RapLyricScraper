Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
GetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-bys at bedtime
Get down, I heard mom, someone lost they grandson
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do, niggas talkin' 'bout
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
My time to show out,
finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth,
my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap,
this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school,
this life gon' catch up soon
Sure 'nough that shit did, twenty-year-old kid
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines
Cause one day my story gon' pay
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do, niggas talkin' 'bout
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
Your bitch wanted cash, get her, know I'm around, boy
Tell Kendrick, move from the throne, I came for it
I hope this fuckin' hit arrange for it, cause goddamn
What you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money?
Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy
[Verse 3]
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doin', long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parler, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her temple, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign,
go rare with my mignon
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do, niggas talkin' 'bout
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
What you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money?
Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy
