Tumblr dreamin' ridin' in a Benz
You don't smoke, but it's cool while you're friends
Silvercity with your girls on the weekend
Seventeen, nights stay out past 10
House party ting turn up with your mans
Arguments all day with your 'rents
Just to go out, gotta fight for this shit
Gotta realize you're a high school girl
Don't matter how you put it, used to fuck niggas
But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah
But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah
But they still trust you
They still fuck with you
Anything you do, anything you do
Everything's for you
Drama is for you
Take that L, you lose
Take that L, you lose
No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
Every lost girl I know is over 26
Every lost girl I know is just too afraid to admit it
You give your body to me, I'll body that like a savage
Give and take, you give it to 'em
They take that shit for granted, yeah
Different than it was before
People 'round you want it more
BFF, oh yeah, for sure
Wonder what they in it for
Take your last relationship
Look how good you treated him
You could birth like four of him
Girl, you never needed him
But they still need you
They still fuck with you
Anything you do, anything you do
Everything's for you
Drama is for you
Take that L, you lose
Girl, that's not me, ohhh
Girl, that's not me, ohhh
Girl, that's not me, ohhh
Girl, that's not me, ohhh
Girl, that's not me, ohhh
