Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do
(Coming down, dripping candy on the ground)
It's that Yonc, your Yonc
In that lingerie, on that chardonnay
Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever, like Bun B
And I'm Redboned yo
I'm really rit' like Donjae
I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma
But no, we escalating, up in this bitch, like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down when it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down when it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn!!!
[Bridge 1: Beyonc]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)
[Hook: Beyonc]
You wake up, flawless,
post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless, flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless,
my diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless,
my Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn
I wake up looking this good
(God damn, God damn, God damn)
And I wouldnt change it if I could
(If I if I, if I, if I)
And you can say what you want, Im the shit
(What you want Im the shit, I'm the shit)
Im the shit, Im the shit, Im the shit
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn!

Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me -

But tell em winning, is my motherfuckin protocol
Cause I score, before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and aint no fuckin soap involved

All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick

Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
