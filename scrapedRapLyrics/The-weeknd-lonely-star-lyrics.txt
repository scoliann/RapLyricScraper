[Intro]
If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that youll remember me
When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Every Thursday
It seems like pain and regret are your best friends
Cause everything you do leads to them, why?
Run, run
But baby, I could be your best friend
And baby, I could fuck you right (ooh whoa)
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, baby you could be a star
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star
Blaming all your sins on your best friends
And nothing's ever ever your fault
Nothing's your fault baby, no
Well baby, you don't need your best friends
Cause I got everything you want
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, baby you could be a star
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star
[Interlude]
If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Light the wrong path
Promise me when they all love you that youll remember me
When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them any other day but Thursday
You belong to me
Every Thursday
I'll wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you
Every Thursday
I exist
Only on Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday...
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday...
I love the guitars
