Ladies and gentlemen, this is Macadelic
I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sipping
Groupies fall in love, I'm like bitch you must be tripping
I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck and nothing 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts,
got diamonds in my chain
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
But it don't make a difference if you crying in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'mma kill more,
I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mil more, play a number one spot on the Billboard
Yeah, people lie, numbers won't
Keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup
Watch the world go up in smoke
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know,
never keep your pockets low
I'mma get that Grammy soon,
fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team, in that pack with me
Hear that Jerm beat banging,
with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be
Tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker,
think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way,
when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
yeah I got raps,
tryna talk shit what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank rolls, I'mma lay low chill, 'til I let that stack
