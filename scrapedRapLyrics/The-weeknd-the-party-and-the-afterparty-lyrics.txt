High heel shoes make you six feet tall

Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call

To pluck the feathers off all the birds

On your knees

And
Oh, I got it girl
I think I'm fuckin' gone, rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' rolled, but I fuckin' pulled
Feelin' like a billion bucks before
I walked through the store
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your lovin'
I need more
I need yours
She ain't lookin' for that un-con-ditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sippin' on this, baby livin' off bliss
Got me drownin' in your love
Got me drownin' in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drownin' from my wrist
Baby, if you knew
The feelin' I would give to you
You..
Cause I got it girl
Oh I got it girl
With me
You
Oh I got it girl
With me
I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stoppin'
So, momma please stop callin'
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fuckin' prove
This feelin' I would give to you
You
Oh I got it girl
Yea, I got it girl
With me
