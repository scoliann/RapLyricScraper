Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more, lost your C notes
Cabbed all day, took the bus back home
Evictions on your door
blame it on the weed, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you, yeah
Just don't blame it on me, that you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me, cause I get it
You're built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressin'
'Specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke
You need more bread
now you got no rent
You blow that money, money
You try to window shop, you blow another hundred
She's fuckin' goons in the day
Hipster nights downtown and your daddy don't know you're out
If they don't let you in
You know where to find me
Cause if you wanna go again
You can always call me
Cause all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind, you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone
We all been alone
Baby just be honest
(XO) Ohh, don't you forget
(XO) Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(XO) We'll be everything you need, just believe
(XO) Yea, (XO) whoa
I love it when your eyes are red
Ah yea, are you on my cloud yet?
Cause I got a brand new cam, can we video feed, can we POV
Why? I wanna catch you at your best
When your hair's a mess
You look so depressed
And you're filled with regret
And you feel like you gotta go home
Cause these nights pass, so much quicker then the days did
Same clothes you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up you need money for ya' face lift
Lust over love
Is ya' mindset
Waken up with most of ya' side wet
Another room, you hear your mom cryin'
Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party
If they won't let you in
You know where to find me
And if you wanna go again
You can always call me
Cus all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone
We all been alone
Baby just be honest
(XO) Ohh, don't you forget
(XO) No, no, don't you worry bout' a thing
(XO) We'll be everything you need, just believe, yeah
(XO) Yeah, (XO) whoa
I need, I need something from you
Oh, there's so much love to pass around
There's too much love
Girl, the night's almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
And girl, it wasn't long ago
Didn't think I'd go this far
Well, I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There's just something that I
Need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Ride it out
Oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out
Just ride it
