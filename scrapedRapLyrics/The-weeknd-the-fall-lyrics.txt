You been picking my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money baby
I wanna show you how I blow money baby
I wanna show you how I throw money baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I ain't scared of the fall (x4)
I've felt the ground before (x4)
Cuz I ain't scared of the fall
Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday
So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
And bout to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "who's next?"
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before
And I ain't scared of the fall
XO (x4)
