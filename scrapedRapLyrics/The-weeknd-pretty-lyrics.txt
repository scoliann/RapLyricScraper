Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come
Whoa oh oh
Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land you're mine
It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been living on the road
And you've been living all alone, at home
Girl I hope, he made you satisfied
Well baby I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land you're mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, a simple man
I try to master the art, of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been living in a cold, cold world, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know when I land you're mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
(Breakdown - The Weeknd harmonizing)
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
C'est tout ce qu'on entend
Les jours se dfilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobin dans ma toile, je les dvoile  nouveaux
10 ans mon ami, que rien d'autre ne compte
Elle n'tait qu'une gamine  ce moment
Souffrant d'un cur bris, une douleur trs profonde
C'est l o je l'ai aperue, seule, prte  entamer ses 17 ans
