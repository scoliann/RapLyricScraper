Girl this summer, you'll be looking for
Youll be looking for me while Im riding in
That brand new whip you wanted
All I ever asked for was patience
(That's all I ever asked and you know it)
Patience and pussy but mostly patience
Swear I used to keep you waiting
Now you're waiting for something better
But girl what's better than this
We were supposed to do big things
Now you're waiting for something better
But girl, what's better than this?
Popping champagne over here
Girl it ain't a thang over here
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here
Popping champagne over here
Girl it ain't a thang over here
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here
[Verse 2: Drake]
Me and my niggas bucking head first
You supposed to be there when my head hurt
Used to be going out hardly, now we wanna party
Celebration on me, well
what's up
Pay homage,
I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed
It can't be that hard to find us
Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess
That's when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects
The boy home, used to take the bus to the block
Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block
I remember seeing Nikk's having to bust up a block
And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit
a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But thats cause everybody else sound is so played out tho'
Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out tho'
A 1000$ bottle it get poured straight out tho'
I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out tho'
I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real
I got hits nigga, you just a bat boy for real
Backwoods got peeled, I smoke away all the tears
Nothing was the same man, including y'all careers
The new Cash Money, the new Roc-A-fella
Bunch of young rich niggas, turn around if you jealous
[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Popping champagne over here
Girl it ain't a thang over here
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here
Popping champagne over here
Girl it ain't a thang over here
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here
On this side...
