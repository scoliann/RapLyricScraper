Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut
Crashing
while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets, and laugh it off
Twisted, sicker than mad cattle,
in fact I'm off
Six different liquors,
with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming, bitch, you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips
is in the attic, armed
with an addict's arm
Earl puts the "ass" in "assassin"
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where her ass go
In my room, redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck
and ups to shut
and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's O.F., buttercup;
go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch, as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
"What you doing?"  nothing much
Would shout some other stuff
Got to fucking bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us
Get up off the pavement, wipe the dirt and vomit off
DopeBoyz hating,
but them faggots is a lot of talk
Cotton soft pussy,
them Odd niggas is Molotov
Cocktails; fucking toss one in your apartment, dog
Wolf Gang, we ain't barking, nah
Try talking on a blog with your fucking arms cut off
Put in a carpet and watch it get auctioned off
The Ace tell Shake's daughter
"We're sorry, but papa's gone, bitch!"
