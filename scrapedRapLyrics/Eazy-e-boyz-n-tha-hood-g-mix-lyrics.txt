[Intro: Dresta]
"Yeah, Gangsta Dresta steps in this, motherfucker. And this one goes out to all the O.G.'s out there. And I can't forget the baby gangstas, what's up, niggas? My nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit, nigga. That got all of y'all on his dick in the first place, yeah. So run that shit E, yeah."
Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Jockin the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car trying to steal an Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck-head pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit
Bored as fuck and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
Niggas out there making that dollar
I pulled up in my '64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinking
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinking
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I bombed on pops, knocked his ol' ass out
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit
Now I'm rolling hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped the '64 'round the telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh, brother
Throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
Walking home I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Now Kat got beat for resisting arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offence on the boy, he'll do some time
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
My niggas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municiple court
Kilo G on trial straight caught a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "FIRE!" then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
The police shot the girl, but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit
