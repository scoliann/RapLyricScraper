After the war I went back to New York
A-After the war I went back to New York
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
[BURR & ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!
Gentlemen of the jury, Im curious, bear with me
Are you aware that were making histry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
The liberty behind
Deliberation
Non-stop!
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel

[BURR]
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent.
Call your first witness
Thats all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing

[BURR]
Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!
Why do you write like youre running out of time?
Write day and night like youre running out of time?
Evry day you fight, like youre running out of time
Keep on fighting. In the meantime
[ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like youre running out of time?

 
Evry day you fight, like youre running out of time

Non-stop!
Corruptions such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colonys economys increasingly stalling and
[HAMILTON]
Honestly, thats why public service
Seems to be calling me
Hes just
Non-stop!
I practiced the law, I practicly perfected it
Ive seen injustice in the world and Ive corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then Ill be Socrates
Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention!
There as a New York junior delegate
[HAMILTON]
Now what Im going to say may sound indelicate
Goes and proposes
his own form of government!
His own plan for a new form of government!
[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!
[ENSEMBLE MAN]
Bright young man

[ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN]
Yo, who the f is this?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Evry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!
like its
Going out of style?
Write day and night like its
Going out of style, hey!

Going out of style, hey!
Do what you do
[BURR]
Alexander?

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Its the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?
Is this a legal matter?
Burr, youre a better lawyer than me
Okay
I know I talk too much, Im abrasive
Youre incredible in court. Youre succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. Youre the solution
The new U.S. Constitution?
[HAMILTON]
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree
[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, thats why we need it
[BURR]
The constitutions a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments
[BURR]
Its full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
Youre making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?
What?
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course
And what if youre backing the wrong horse?
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I dont understand how you stand to the side
Ill keep all my plans
Close to my chest

Ill wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
Im taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow
[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London
Im accompanied by someone who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband
Who will keep me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun
but theres no one
Who can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander
Angelica
Dont forget to write
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that youre alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!
How do you write like youre
Running out of time?
Write day and night like youre
Running out of time?
Are you running out of time?
Running out of time?

Running out of time?
Running out of time
Running out of time
Awwww!
How do you write like tomorrow wont arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write evry second youre alive?
Evry second youre alive? Evry second youre alive?
[WASHINGTON]
They are asking me to lead
Im asking you to be my right hand man

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
I know its a lot to ask

[HAMILTON]
Treasury or State?

[WASHINGTON]
To leave behind the world you know
[HAMILTON]
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

[WASHINGTON]
Treasury
Lets go
I have to leave
Alexander
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now
Helpless
They are asking me to lead
Look around, isnt this enough?
[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
What would be enough
To
Be satisfied
Isnt this enough?
What would be enough?
[WASH]
History has its eyes

On

You!
History has its eyes on you
[HAMILTON]
I am not throwin away my shot!
I am not throwin away my shot!
I am not throwin away my shot!
Just you wait!
Just you wait!

Alexander Hamilton
Hamilton, just you wait!
