[Verse 1: Eminem]
Said you want a little company and I love it cause the thrills cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, hed wanna kill me
But its time you met the real me, filthy
But wasnt always, will be
Your pill refill and Ill still be
Your addiction, you can touch a prescription, but dont fill me
I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly, we hit the flight deck and got sprung, pew
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills, just the effects of each other
But we gon' film cause I will want your ex to see
(Get it?) that...
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[Verse 2: Eminem]
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And Ill be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But dont you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way youll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
Youre nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But Im a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me, but at night, if you seek those thrills
What I expect to be?
Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And dont lecture me, just accept that...
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
