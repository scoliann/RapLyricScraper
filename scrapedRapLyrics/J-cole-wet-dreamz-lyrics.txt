Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep, and
Wet dreaming, thinkin' that I'm smashin', but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before?"
Damn
[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I wrote back and said, "Of course I had sex before"
Knowing I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinking how that body look naked
When you laying on the bed
Teacher, please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan"
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talking shit, knowing damn well I was a virgin, fuck
[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
You know that feeling when you know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying, "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watching pornos, trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth
Yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, cause..."

[Hook]
Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
