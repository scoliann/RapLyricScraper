I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, itll make the shit last
Dont make it too easy, girl, dont take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and youve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe its just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you dont love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
Its just amazing, girl, all I can say is
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Everythings adding up, youve been through hell and back
That's why youre bad as fuck and you
...B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches Im badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when Im straddling
And my shits so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
Pink Friday Records
OVO
Done did the pop tour, Im the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
Its MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, Im dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause Im fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
Ill give it all away, dont care what the people say
Ill be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sag
Im a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if Im guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
Its just amazing, girl, all I can say is
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
Its just amazing, girl, all I can say is
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Everythings adding up, youve been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are
