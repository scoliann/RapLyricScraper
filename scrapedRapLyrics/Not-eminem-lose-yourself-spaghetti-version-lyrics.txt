[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
Or one spaghetti, to seize every spaghetti you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
[Verse 1]
His palms are spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti
There's vomit on his spaghetti already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti
To drop spaghetti, but he keeps on spaghetti
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes spaghetti
He opens his mouth but spaghetti won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The spaghetti's run out, time's up, over - blaow!
Snap back to spaghetti, oh! - there goes gravity
Oh - there goes spaghetti, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't
Give up spaghetti nope, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's spaghetti
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this spaghetti,
Back to the lab again
this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this spaghetti
hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in
Spaghetti (x4)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This spaghetti comes once in a lifetime
[Verse 2]
The spaghetti's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This spaghetti is mine for the taking
Make me spaghetti, as we move toward a New World spaghetti
A normal life is spaghetti; but superspaghetti's
Close to spaghetti, it only grows harder
Homie grows spaghetti, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all spaghetti, coast to coast spaghetti
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown spaghetti from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own spaghetti
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold spaghetti
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold spaghetti
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and spaghetti. And so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, spaghetti
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum da-dah
[Verse 3]
No more games, I'mma change what you call spaghetti
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs spaghetti
I was playin' in the spaghetti, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and spaghetti'ed off stage
But I kept rhyming and spaghetti right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's spaghetti'ing the Pied Piper
All the spaghetti inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my spaghetti
Five and
I can't provide the right type of
Spaghetti for my family
cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy spaghetti
and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi spaghetti, this is my life
And this spaghetti is so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my spaghetti plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being spaghetti and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in spaghetti, another day of spaghetti
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like spaghetti
To formulate spaghetti, or end up in jail or shot
Spaghetti is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Spaghetti I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in spaghetti's Lot
So here I go it's my shot. Spaghetti: fail me not
This may be the only spaghetti that I got
Spaghetti
