(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter
Hell no, you can't use my lip gloss,
pop a perc', now I'm on lift off
Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross,
you bitches make a nigga dick soft
Bitch, ball like I'm at tip off,
get it-get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans, I can slip off,
bitch, I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for five years,
guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me, do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes I am an icon
, that's me on your T-shirt
.THOUGHT YOU KNEW BETTER!
Do your fucking research
You aint know, this the no rip zone,
this the "You cant beat Nic' zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home,
I live next door to Brad Pitts home
I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too,
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick' magnitude, even if they had a longitude | latitude
Listen up ho, this is my territory,
you are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch Im hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wanna see her (Seer/CR)
Motherfuckers (B/be) flexin, motherfuckers acting (Actors, A.R)
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Aint pushing out, I'mma give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick!
Wack sauce, I can hear it in your tone,
this nigga keep staring at my phone
But if youre ugly, its a no text zone, Its a no sex zone, its a no flex zone
Wack sauce, I can hear it in your tone,
this nigga keep staring at my phone
But if youre ugly its a no text zone, its a no sex zone, its a no flex zone
