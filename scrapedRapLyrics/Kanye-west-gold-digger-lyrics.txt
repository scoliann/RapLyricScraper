[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me
[Hook]
(She give me money)
Now, I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
(She give me money)
broke niggas
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: "I can tell you rock,
I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm."
But I'm looking for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez,
four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz?
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her
[Hook]
(She give me money)
Now, I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
(She give me money)
broke niggas
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
[Verse 2]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walking around looking like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!
[Hook]
(She give me money)
Now, I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
(She give me money)
broke niggas
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
[Verse 3]
Now, I ain't saying you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up your sleeves
watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep calling and trying, but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave your ass for a white girl
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
Get down girl, go 'head, get down
