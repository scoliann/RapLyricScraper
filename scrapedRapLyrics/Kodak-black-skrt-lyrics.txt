stick and move
I thought I said I'm done with you
Fuck my school and fuck my teacher too
Sniper on the roof, he playing peek-a-boo
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
Jump in that Jag, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
When I say keep the poker, I ain't talking bout' no beans
Project Baby, you know I got baby bottles full of lean
I've been through so much of shit, this shit'll' make a nigga sing
I remember rocking bugle boy, now rock designer jeans
It's 1k, I got 22k and all my niggas bling
Hit the club on them jiggas, you know all my niggas geeked
I finessed him
life done dropped a lot of weight on me
You my dawg then just be my dawg and don't you change on me
I ain't in no gang, but if you run up I'm gon' bang homie
I thought I said I'm done with you
Fuck my school and fuck my teacher too
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
Jump in that Jag, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
