Clams Casino,
ASAP
(Wassup)
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup (Wassup)
Back once again,
sipping Henn, mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin Benjamins
Spinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz
Dividends made a change of plans well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees
and I smoke that OG
Kush
mothafuck the police,
all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sipping on that codeine
We hustle hard no sleep,
your bitch loose that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a faade
Times is really hard,
I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are
[Hook]
I be that pretty mothafucka,
Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second
Pretty mothafucka,
Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching we gon' make it in a second
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup
(Wassup)
Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror
Yeah, clothes getting weirder
Money get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up
The nerve of this dude
But I'm cool as a fan,
40 ounce full of brew
