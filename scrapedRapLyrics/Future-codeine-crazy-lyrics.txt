Codeine crazy, yeah
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly
Pour that bubbly, we done went through too much
You hear me?
Pour that bubbly, drink that muddy, drink that muddy
When we're cuddling, yeah I'm covered in
I was dug in it, I was just loving it
That's for them other niggas, that's for them other bitches
They ain't for you dog, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you shorty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly, I'm drinking bubbly
Take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah
Audemar, this not a carnival, this is a Royal Oak Cartier
Dom Perignon I get down with the brown
I get chauffeured around
I pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town
I corrupt your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on them grounds with the dealers and hound
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass em around
I say everything triple time, Rollie, AP, Hublot triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat, everytime a nigga talk a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette
run it back you hear my intellect
Celebratin like the championship, celebratin like the championship
Celebratin like the championship, celebratin like the championship
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you...
Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
Abu Dhabi, niggas straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson; put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone - waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' off of me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another 60 thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick and got my brain washed
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil lil liquor out, pour a lil malt liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene its homicide
Diamond pinky ring  a lollipop
Fuck the hate  I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin harder than the Pacers
I been tryin to have some patience
Told my momma she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gonna put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
Im making U.S.D's overseas
Thats U.S. dollars that you cant achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said Nigga please.
For that white girl, she said Nigga please.
Playin poker  now were back at Strokers
I forgot her name, but her pussys soakin
When I seen her on a pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin myself that Im still gettin loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control this
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles
These niggas who bogus, let's pour up a pint
I'ma fuck around and faint like I'm Kid Cudi probably
I fuck around and faint, I'ma fall on a drink
Rockin Tom Ford, poppin molly
Married to this motherfuckin money
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo, I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in the shit and some mo'
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might go after Madonna, I get the crack in the summer
Strapped in the lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partna
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Dont you panic panoramic companion
They was tryna' serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that comes with these millions
I'm taking everything that comes with my children
Yeah yeah
Pour that bubbly, drink that muddy, drink that muddy
When we're cuddling, yeah I'm covered in
I was dug in it, I was just loving it
That's for them other niggas, that's for them other bitches
They ain't for you dog, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you shorty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
