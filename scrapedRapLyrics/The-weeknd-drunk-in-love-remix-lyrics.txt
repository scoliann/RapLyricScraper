I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on,
bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty,
niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, every body got a crib
Did an album just to do it,
droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week,
I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night
