She got a body like an hourglass
But I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac
But I can send you into overdrive
(You've been waiting for that, step on up, swing your bat)
See, anybody could be bad to you
You need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah
Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (Ill let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ahhh, hey!)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (Ill let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ahhh, hey!)
