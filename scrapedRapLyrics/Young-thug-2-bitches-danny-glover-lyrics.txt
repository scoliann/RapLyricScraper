Thugger
Stoner Life, YSL
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my papi for her, fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot!)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets
Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud,
that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I gotta pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my papi for her, fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot!)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets
I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't
All these niggas pussy niggas, tellin' on they partner
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K
And I'mma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'mma name myself Young Thug Attendant
100 bands at a time I fronted you bags, but you
I don't like using profanity, but the Young Thugger will gut you
All of my cups are muddy
I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy
, all of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof
All the niggas dogs goin', "Roof"
nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin, then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my papi for her, fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot!)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets
