Let's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"
Told me that she two on, ha, that's cute we a few on
I could show you what to do in this bitch
Take the addy with the water pop two and then sip
Me, you and your bitch
And we talkin' bout life, love too and this dick
First I had her in the six, then we had her in the six
You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah
Got a bad one we could call it Kelly Rowland
Oh she get the jelly rollin',
Akinyele in the telly
Cause she open I could tell that she from Oakland
Pasadena, what up?
[Hook: Drake]
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2
A nigga got a woosah, comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got 'em all a cheque without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga
Yea, I always been on, I always been too on
For like the past five years all these niggas wanna shine
I got the flashlight here man
Bout to hit the gas right here man
Old soul livin' in the past life here man
You, bring the cash right here man
Miracle, sit your ass right here man
Man, you know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yea, OVO sound man that's everyday
It's Young Money Records get the record straight
[Outro: Drake]
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2 on
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2
[Part 2: "Thotful"]
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something you know
And you know, you love to get 2 On
