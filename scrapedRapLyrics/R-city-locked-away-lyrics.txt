[Chorus: Adam Levine]
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
Right about now
If a judge 'for life' me, would ya stay by my side?
Or is you gonna say goodbye?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty, would it be alright?
Now tell me would you really ride for me?
Baby tell me would you die for me?
Baby don't lie to me
If I didn't have anything
I wanna know, would you stick around?
Chorus: Adam Levine
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I did not have nothing else to give but love
Gyal me need fi know
Now tell me would you really ride for me?
Baby tell me would you die for me?
Would you spend your whole life with me?
Would you be there to always hold me down?
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
