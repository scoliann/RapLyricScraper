[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I dont even know if I believe it when Im sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in
Every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for em
They just say it's wack
But they dont know what dope is
And I dont know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me
I owe my life to you
But for the life of me,
I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, its dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick;
you gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic or you gon' hug me
But I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do, cause
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle;
you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so Im puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy
Or you dont believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like Im your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label; let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, Im cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fucks sake!
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them
I don't see none of them;
all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack,
maggots!
And the crackers' ass,
little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers;
I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then Im packin' up my bags
And as Im leavin',
Ill guarantee they'll scream
"Dre, dont leave us like that, man!", cause
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
