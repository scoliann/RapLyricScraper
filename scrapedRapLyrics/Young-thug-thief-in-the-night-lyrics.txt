Just like a G, you know?
Trouble, Trouble, what's popping, 5?
B4, let's do it
Yeeeee!
I wake up and go get me some new money
You know I'm living like a G
These lil niggas ain't gonna take nothin' from me
You know we do it like a G
I swear to God I fuck on anyone
Just like a gangsta, just like a G
This Duct Tape and YSL
You know I do it like a G
G's up hoes down
G's up hoes down
G's up hoes down
G's up hoes down
G's up hoes down
G's up hoes down
G's up hoes down
G's up hoes down
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil babe on ice
I make the paper like rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike
I go down on a dyke, I go up on my price
I might drop Kimbo Slice,
kidnap like Uncle Ice
I got grits at the beach and they white like a rice
Let Trouble take your life
After I give you five
Straight put that five to the side
It ain't no question how nigga gon' ride
When they come with them questions
My nigga get quiet, sh sh, nigga sit quiet, sh sh
I am not taking no disrespect
You Patrick Ewing, you pump fakin'
No that won't happen on me
I drop a key like the mafuckin' beat
I look good as your dad on a Friday
So many cars I gotta buy a driveway
Never gon' let 'em live a nigga crime day
Serving these X and P's instead of poppin'
Pockets fat up like they jumped 'em
YSL, that slimy anaconda
Bicking back, being bool like a uncle
I'm so geeked up I might fuck a condom
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil babe on ice
I make the paper like Rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike
I get 'em all on the rice
She didn't even know what it was but she taste it
I dig in, her shit sound like Jason
I be on Percocets more than occasion
They betting on me like in Vegas
Betting on me like I'm Vegas
Stick to the code man, there won't be no trace
Thugga Thugga, tell me what would you say?
What would you say?
No J Money, but my gun say, "Bow"
Pop a molly, look at her then fiend
I'm the target mofucka, no beam
No this shit is not good as it seems
I might give her the boot with no jeans
I kick shit like a chong and a ching
Im a boss, I'm bout that unity
Sandwiches, you know you in between
And you gotta know we at the green
You gotta be young nigga, wilder than Billie Jean
Gotta have paper for lawyer fees
You ain't with it, you a L
Still getting it, yeah, bails
Break it down on the scale
If it add up, hell yeah, I do it
Lap back as he ran to it
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil babe on ice
I make the paper like Rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike
