Random disclaimer:
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay? It's fuckin' fiction. If anything happens, don't fuckin' blame me, white America,
fuck Bill O'Reilly.
4, 3, 2, 1
What the fuck I look like, saying I'm sorry
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fucking Wolves that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash black hoodies,
try something
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
[Hook]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fuckin'
radical

I'm motherfuckin' radical
Left, right, left, right
[Interlude]
Odd Future Wolf Gang, came together cause we ain't have nobody else.
And you? You might just be one of us. Are you?
Fuck cops, I'm a fucking rock star
Rebellion and defiance makes my muthafuckin' cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, all some fucking retards
Fuck school, I'm a fuck up?
Fuck Harvard
I ain't got no fucking money (hey mom)
I ain't got no muthafuckin' daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Child support ain't come, that faggot still ain't bought me anything
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
[Hook]
They want us to go to they schools and be fucking miserable at they fucking college, studying that bullshit, fuck that.

I'm not saying to go out and do some stupid shit, commit crimes. What I'm trying to tell you is, do what the fuck you want.
Stand for what the fuck you believe in, and don't let nobody tell you can't do what the fuck you want.
I'm a fucking unicorn, and fuck anybody who say I'm not. Wolf Gang
[Bridge]
Fuck your traditions, fuck your positions
Fuck your religion, fuck your decisions
See, they're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
You gotta let 'em go
 You gotta let these shits go, man. It's not making sense to you right now but. All these little dreams you got, they're not shit. All this rebellion, all this crazy shit you got, saying this shit. Getting too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it. Growing up, your dreams are getting bigger. You gotta look at reality, understand that shit so you don't get caught. I'm just being real
 Nigga, fuck you
 I'm just trying to help you man, trust me
 Look, I mature day after day nigga. You don't know shit, you're a fucking therapist
 Whatever
