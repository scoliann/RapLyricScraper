It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets
And the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Got the snipers in the dually truck and we tooly'd up
I be tryin' change my life , but a monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back
(skrrr, skrrr)
All about the mula
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God
Soon as the floor hits my feet I'm getting high
Eyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink
Probably think the liquor laced
Nah bitch, I'm 1K
And I'm gonna keep it one-hund' though
Biting down, 'bout to rip my tongue off
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets
And the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Slide in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy
Then I pulled up in a bucket
but I used to want to a Hemi
And I'm pouring up the round then I'm sippin on Remy
I ain't fuckin with that white shit I'm throwed off Henny
And the Feds keep lurkin' cause the boys keep talkin'
Ritz Carlton
Ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty niggas strapped, we the 49'ers
50 chains on, diamonds flashing like Kodak
I remember toting .38, now I got a semi
Could have been had a baby K
But I wasn't ready
Shawty say she like my Larry Pack
Thought I went to Kelly
Nah baby I ain't want no Wap, I just want the Fetty
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets
And the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Ay, ay ay, ay, ay ay ay, skrr, ay, ay ay ay, ay, ay ay
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
