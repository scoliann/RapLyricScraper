Old English,
800 capsules of Molly
Just be very still, I aint gonna hurt anybody
Hell nah, I ain't Twelve, but if I like it I cop it

Catch me ridin' with them slimes, them my youngins
Catch me boolin' with them slimes, them my youngins

Catch me sliding with the slimes cause them my youngins
Chrissy Carter bezel inside my baby pampers, eww

I wear that white, I cook that white, but I am not no chef
Add a little soda, put the tan on it

One night I was in Santos, it was lit like a candle
I was fly like a bird, I had on Stssy Bape camo
With a cutie espanol, she had a booty like J-Lo
She has to trap in the bando, cause her momma got cancer
She cant work in the states because her green papers aint legal
Fuck a "da me un peso", she be like "run de un peso"
Push the molly to Pedro, so she can feed her abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that dance pole
She cant lose she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo-lian
So, there she get money vicarious off her friends though
birdies
