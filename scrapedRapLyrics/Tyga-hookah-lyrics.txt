[Intro: Young Thug]
Baby, pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Aye, baby, just pass me the hookah
[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Tearin' up the place
I'm a rich nigga, got Chanel on my waist
Run up on me playin', I'mma aim it at ya face
And that go for anybody, anyway, aye
I'm a rich blood, by the way
And I'm havin' swag, Rollie old like a tape
Fish scale, yeah, I got these bitches on the bait
Don't wanna talk, man, I said, I need some space
Woop, woop, woop, my new car geeked up
I just paid a cop, now I'm runnin' out of court
Panoramic top, I'mma put it on the rocks
Crawl, walk and hop, got all of these bitches shocked, aye
Stone molly whiter than my socks
I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout guap
Clone a young nigga and still flop
I buy pints by the two no Pac
Young Thug
Baby, pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Aye, baby, just pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah, aye
Baby, pass me the hookah, aye
Baby, pass me the hookah
Pass me the hookah, pass the hookah, pass the hookah
Ah, rubbin' on my chain, blowin' cloudmatic
Smoke somethin' with a G and bend that ass backwards
Lay back, relax and talk mathematics
Later on, we test a little sex practice
Write my name on the wall
Money in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt, say, where the hookah y'all?
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set
Mozart art on the block, so wet
I got her where I want her and I ain't done yet
Lookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight, yeah
Tell them bitches, fuck that
You with Aladdin, bet I got a magic carpet for that ass, yes
I'm also on one, got two Olsen's on me
Big homie, Young Thugger Thugger, rollin'
Rolls Royce so shorty
Ah, Ben Frank baddies in the Benz waggin'
You know she want a ride home, hop on the band wagon
I got the chain saggy, you know that life lavish
Lifestyles like this, gon' need magnums
Pass baby,
welcome to rich class, baby
You all Maybelline, with ya new Celine
Audemars on lean, cars on sheen
You white girl, but black girl ghetto fly thing
It's verified, they ain't on your sea level
Watered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular
My baby on it, high at the crack of dawnin'
Body shape, figure eight, like Picasso draw ya
Oh, yes, I'm winnin', bling kingin', ring blingin'
Like, like, for no reason, let's get closer, closed in
Remove your clothes, we close friends
Don't get choked smokin' OG Oakland, shout out Oakland
For all my bitches that smoke hookah
