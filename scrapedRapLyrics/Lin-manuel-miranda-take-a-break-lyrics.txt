One two three four five six seven eight nine!
My dearest, Angelica
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
I trust youll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
Im a polymath,
a massive pain
Madison is Banquo
Jeffersons Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away
Take a break
Alexander
Your son is nine years old today
And he has something that hed like to say
Philip, take it away
[PHILIP]
Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just
To show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you cant write mine
I practice French
And play piano with my mother
I have a sister,
but I want a little brother
My daddys trying to start Americas bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!
[HAMILTON]
What!


Uh-huh!


Okay!



Bravo!
Take a break
Hey, our kid is pretty great
Lets go upstate
Ive got so much on my plate
We can all go stay with my father
Theres a lake I know
[ELIZA]
In a nearby park

[HAMILTON]
Id love to go

[ELIZA]
You and I can go when the night gets dark
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Dont stop til you agree
Your favrite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
Theres someone in your corner all the way across the sea
In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and youve consumed my waking days
With a comma after dearest. Youve written
My dearest, Angelica.
Im coming home this summer
At my sisters invitation
Ill be there with your famly
If you make your way upstate
I know youre very busy
I know your works important
But Im crossing the ocean and I just cant wait
You will only be a moment away
Alexander, come downstairs.
Angelicas arriving today!
[ELIZA]
Angelica!

[ANGELICA]
Eliza!
The Schuyler sisters!
Alexander
Hi
Its good to see your face
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesnt have a real job anyway
youre not joining us?
Wait
Alexander, I came all this way
Take a break
You know I have to get my plan through Congress
I lose my job if I dont get my plan through Congress
[ELIZA AND ANGELICA]
We can all go stay with our father
Take a break and get away
we can stay
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now
We can go
When the night gets dark
[ANGELICA]
Ill miss your face
Screw your courage to the sticking place
If you take your time

You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream
I have to get my plan through Congress
I cant stop until I get this plan through Congress
