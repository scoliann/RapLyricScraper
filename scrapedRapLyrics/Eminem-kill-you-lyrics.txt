[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]
When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
Cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These mothafuckas are thinking I'm playing
Thinking I'm saying the shit
Cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it
Put your hands down, bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up, slut! You're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut; okay, Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke
And we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You're goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious
Vain Vicodin, vrin vrin vrin!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts; bitch, I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gonna never stop beefing, I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothing but a girl to me
[Hook]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (ha ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (cause why?)
Bitch, I'ma kill you; like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't "acid rap," but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint?
No, just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him you give him an impulse
To do it again then
If he does it again, you'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the tenth
Bitch, I'ma kill you; I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange
After you wash it three or four times in a tub
But that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine, out of our minds and we want in yours; let us in or I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gonna never stop beefing, I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothing but a girl to me

I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (ha ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (cause why?)
Know why I say these things?
Cause ladies' screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80 G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all 70,000 pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O.J
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep egging me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me, answer me, or I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gonna never stop beefing, I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothing but a girl to me
[Hook]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (ha ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (cause why?)
Ha ha, I'm just playing, ladies
You know I love you
