It do not matter
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Money so old that its spoiled
My lil' bitch so spoiled
I rub her down in oil
I got money now you know it
Diamonds on my teeth
Your shit look like foil
Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal
None of these hoes got no morals
All my niggas G'ed up
My glasses be Dita
Never thought it would be days I could kick my feet up
Never though that she would need me that much if I leave her
It do not matter
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
All it is is faction, no time for acting, all this money lasting
Like go out to eat, get that blackened salmon
When I'm with my girl were Pharrell and Vashtie
That mean we are not lasting
In that pussy you know I like it rough, then I'm just blasting
Tell that lil bitch that I'm really from Mars, bitch do not start
Pull up my car automatic, dealt with a star
It do not matter
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
