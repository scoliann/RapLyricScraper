She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She say she love my lolly

She say she love my lolly

[Verse 1: Maejor Ali]
She say she love to party, girl, I love your body
Why you on the table? Cause you know I'm watching
She say she love my molly

Club about to close, come up out them clothes
I'm about to give you what you asking for
Order what you want girl, it ain't no problem
I'mma tell the waitress that my baby need a bottle
Order what you want, said it ain't no problem
Got a piece of candy and it's all for you
She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She say she love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Throwing up a G note, like I'm at a casino
I'm all fancy, yeah I'm popping Pellegrino
I'm in the El Camino when I pull up on the scene though
You know I'm a real OG and baby I ain't from the T.O
I'm messing with the clique though, meet me on the sixth floor
No you ain't a model, you should let me take some pics though
Windows down, speakers loud, look down at my sneakers now
Fifty for the necklace, look down at my set list
Got your girlfriend at my crib watching Netflix
Let's just admit that I'm the bestest
Guess this, you ain't never ever on the guest list
Order what you want girl, it ain't no problem
I'mma tell the waitress that my baby need a bottle
Order what you want, said it ain't no problem
Got a piece of candy and it's all for you
She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She say she love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly
Ass everywhere, throw them dollars in the air (mhmm)
Bring your swimming gear, Juicy J the millionaire (mhmm)
She pop that pussy on me, I fell back in the chair
Bands a make her dance, molly make her lose them underwear
And I think she love me, I've been hitting it for a week (swish)
need a super freak like Ricky
I'm Rick James bitch,
I slip myself a mickey
Got so much money in my pocket
With silicone racks with a real big ass
Make her bounce it like hydraulics
Kevin Hart, I got purple on the plane (we smoking)
Let's call the boys (let's go), let's run a train (trippy)
She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She say she love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly
