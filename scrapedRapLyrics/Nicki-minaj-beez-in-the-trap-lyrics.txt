[Hook x2]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
Man I been did that, man I been popped off
And if she ain't trying to give it up she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-ie,
bitch bust that open
Might spend a couple thou' just to bust that open
Rip it off no joking, like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggas move weight in the South but live in Hoboken
Bitch, I spit that crack, like I'm in that trap
So if you need a hit then I'm with that bat
[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Okay now Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, put it in your kidney
Got a new LS 450, ain't no keys in this do-hicky
If I weren't rapping I'd be trapping
If I weren't trapping I'd be pimping
If I weren't pimping I'd be getting it, period
I don't smoke no bobby, but my denim be from ricky
Got your girl on molly
and we smokin' loud and drinkin'
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin'
If you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin
Money, thousands,
True Religion trousers
Got a private home, started from them public houses
Hair weave killer,
causing her arousal
Audi A8,
told them "outtie 5000," uh
Damn, damn what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Man I'm out in Texas,
man, I'm out in A-town
Then I'm up in Chi-town or Miami shuttin' it down
It's that New Orleans,
it's LA or The Bay
It's New York,
Philly,
and the whole DMV
I'm a Detroit Player,
man it's North-South Cack
Ohio,
Pittsburgh, got St. Louis on deck
It's Delaware, Connecticut,
it's New Jersey got hella bricks
It's Queens,
Brooklyn,
and yeah, they wildin'
Bronx,
Harlem,
and Staten Island
