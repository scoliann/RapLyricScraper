[Hook: Keith Ape]
Don't Forget
Underwater squad
I still got camo on my body
Orca ninjas go Rambo
[Verse 1: Jay Allday]
Don't forget! Don't forget! That we are the best
Yeah it shines yeah it shines yes
Mind your own business you are you I am me
spread our wings and swim on money
C-O-H-O-R-T, we the Cohort, pay these boys
Motherfucker fucker, your mouth goes  (fuck 'em)
You are you, I am me, so quickly accept that shit
When you insult others
[Verse 2: Loota]
Watering brain cell is a daily routine, kiss to a blunt
I tie my hair then go on to a battlefield
Open the map of the world, them ninjas on the mission
Slash them obstacles with no hesitation
Just like kill bill all humans are lonely at the end
You best leave as much as you can
Mothafucka, y'all can't feel my pain
No excuses are prepared
[Verse 3: Keith Ape]
Bitch, I'm a zombie
Drank too much crap codeine
Than a muthafucking ape
I lay in a tub and shop
Bape Bape Bape Bape Bape
Killer Whale, Killer Whale, Killer Whale, Killer Whales
We're 'bout to swim with money
So dont forget my name, don't forget my team
If you forget our name, youll lose your ear
[Verse 4: Okasian]
I'm a muthafucking trendsetter (Don't forget me)
All my shit very rare, never seen em, have you? (Never seen it)
Dont believe your man, he ain't making no money
Bullshitting, bullshitting he ain't making no money
Still camo on my body, worn with sharkskin
This is Gangnam Street
through the alleyway we go outer space
crybaby phone in my pocket
My mind spun and spun to place, Kim Yuna
[Verse 5: KOHH]
Never! Never! Never forget!
Dont forget to never forget
This, that, and that over there: which one is important?
Get rid of unnecessary things
You could be happy with having only what you need
Thank you
I walk with my own feet
New shoes get dirty again
Air force 1s with no laces
Or cheap converses with heavy leather jackets on
Feels like a rockstar
Im listening to The Blue Hearts while Im chewing gum
Said Mashi (Marcy)
I ain't talkin Tashiro
Its weak to talk about the past
Its about time you let go of your past
