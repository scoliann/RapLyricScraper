[Produced by Timbaland]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
Cause I don't fucking need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em looking good
But I don't fucking feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talking 'bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's "beep beep" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up
Shit, I part with nothing, y'all be fronting
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothing, never happen;
I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion, I got no patience
And I hate waitin'; ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
We doing big pimpin', we spending cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimping on B.L.A.D.E's
We doing big pimpin' up in N.Y.C
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
[Verse 2: Bun B]
Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Coming straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's "my scenario"
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointing; they say, "There he go!"
Now these motherfuckers know we carry more
Heat than a little bit;
we don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us coming down on yo' SLAB
Living ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flying to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breaking these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot,
then the Glock start poppin', like ozone
We keep hoes crunk, like Trigger-man
Getting blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.E's
[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Smoking out, pouring up, keeping lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it "buck"
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall,
nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rapping, baby, I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily, no record til whitey pay me
Uhhh, now what y'all know 'bout them Texas boys?
Coming down in candied toys, smoking weed and talking noise
[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades,
sippin' that Ray
Standing on the corner of my block hustlin'
Still getting that cane
Half what I paid slipping right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spending cheese
With B.U.N. B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughing it up,
Jigga Man: that's what's up
