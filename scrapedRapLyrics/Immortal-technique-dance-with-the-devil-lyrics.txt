I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was making a million
Being the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down,
but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hanging out selling bags in the projects
Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities in other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed
Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So Billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
Starting fights over little shit up on the block
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
Working overtime for making money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treating him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
Even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club
But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
Standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
And they wanted to test him before business started
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
So now he had a choice between going back to his life
Or making money with made men up in the cyph'
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three
Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw"
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screaming "Shut the fuck up and stop moving around"
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he had broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
[Sample]
I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back
Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
Cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were raping her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth?
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there
And right then, he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen, cause the story that I'm telling is true
Cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom, too
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black; color is not restricted
You have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because the dance with the devil might last you forever
[Intro: Immortal Technique]
Oh y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh? Well its not
You didnt count on a fallen angel getting back into the grace of god and coming after you
Yall niggas aint shit
Your producers aint shit. Your fuckin' A & R aint shit
Your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
Show no compassion like havin a straight-faced orgasm
Have his half-a-ten bitch suck my friends dick
In the mean time, you can french kiss this clenched fist
Diabolic
A one-man brigade spreading cancer plague
Fist fuckin a pussys face
Holdin' a hand grenade
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction
Youre faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
Im 'bout to blow up like NASA Challenger computer chips
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
Im like time itself, Im gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin a chrome piece
Im illmatic, you wont make it home like Jeromes niece
Ill sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
So youre nothing, like diversity without equality
Produces more digits than 22 divided by 7
Youre like Kevin Spacey, your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet
Face it, youre too basic
Youre never gonna make it
Like children walking through Antarctica, butt naked
