Baby let me put your panties to the side

Cause you remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me
You remind me of something
But I dont know what it is right now
You remind me of something

Uh, on the real no lie
I dont know what it is but you just my type
Everything just right, B said put it to the left
Dont listen to the hype though
Got a cup in your hand
Baby sitting but you aint got no kids
We aint leaving til there aint no more left
Cant see no time on the Rolex
I could tell you a freak, go show it
Looking for the after party, where the door at?
Dough on the floor like a doormat
Baby you know where to throw that

Unless you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex try to fight you
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand
So high, aint nowhere to land
You remind me of something missing
Missus, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the tension
If I get a minute, Ill put your bad ass in detention
