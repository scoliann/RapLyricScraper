If you leave this time I fear that you'll be gone for good
So I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
It seems that you're the only reason for it
I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
So the iceberg never broke and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poke
And I poked at it
but it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more
and in my notepad, man I wrote
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it, if it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last I'mma hope, so iceberg don't float
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit, it'll be grand as,
ten Grammies or my granny still standing with a note that read ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most, one day it'll make you grow
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult
When the bright cameras are still cramming in your face and it provoke
You to act mannish, just stay planted cause you reaping what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and keep a noose from 'round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it, when you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck you would do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em lord? Do you hear 'em lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when remorse that I give
when they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive"
When they never see good in me
even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
