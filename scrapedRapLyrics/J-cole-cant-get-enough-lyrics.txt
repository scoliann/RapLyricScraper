[Intro- J. Cole]
Cole World,
Southside
Cant get enough, cant get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out
Now I aint got no kids yet, but this right heres for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but thats how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter,
probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rocking with the best mane, dress game down to the sex game
Wont brag, but the boy been blessed mane
let you play with the stick - Ovechkin
She calling, she texting, shes falling, but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl cause a nigga dont play them Xgames
Nope! Straight sexing no handcuff or arresting
And I aint coming offa my last name cause I really cant take no stressing
'bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, He a bad boy
But Im signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids
She said I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot so I cant let you go
She said I, cant get enough, cant get enough (I need that)
I, cant get enough, cant get enough (I need that)
I cant get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go but I just could not, so dont you stop, I need that
Hey, Globetrotter
Cole hotter even way out in London town
Hoes holla cause they love my sound
and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch thatll cut all night, thatll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight, tryna get my last little nut, all \right?
She be down for whatever, whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight,
on the grind tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches
She said I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot so I cant let you go
She said I, cant get enough, cant get enough (I need that)
I, cant get enough, cant get enough (I need that)
I cant get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go but I just could not, so dont you stop, I need that
Hey, Cole World, baby, aint nothing sunny
I see em hating, but it aint nothing to me
Im from the Ville,
where they bang for the money
And carry fo-fives like change for a twenty
So what I look like scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that girl, lets make a track
Ill beat the pussy up, thats the hook right thurr
Thats the hook, right there
Theres the hook, right there
Never mind that, girl, lets make a track
Ill beat the pussy up, thats the hook right thurr
She said I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot so I cant let you go
She said I, cant get enough, cant get enough (I need that)
I, cant get enough, cant get enough (I need that)
I cant get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go but I just could not, so dont you stop, I need that
