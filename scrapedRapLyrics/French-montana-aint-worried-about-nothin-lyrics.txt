Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' round with that work, strapped up with that Nina
Got two bad bitches with me, Molly Aquafina
Money don't mean nothing, niggas don't feel you when they see you
My whole 'hood love me, but now a nigga wanna touch me
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' 'round through East Tremont
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Ridin' 'round with that Nina
Ridin' 'round with that AK, that HK, that SK
That beam on the scope
Window down, blowin' smoke
Niggas front and be broke
Try rob me, gon' get smoked
That gun automatic, my car automatic
Ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Money don't mean nothin' (nada), bitches don't mean nothin' (nada)
Come here with your hand out, nigga I don't owe you nothin' (nana)
I'm ridin' round with that work, Max lost trial I'm hurt
I'll ride through Mott Haven, I'll ride through Castle Hill
You know that Coupe half a million, fuck how niggas feel
