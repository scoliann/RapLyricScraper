Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next thing,
YMCMB (ah)
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight Ill ease your mind
Thats why Im calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
Its hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor
all tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of underground kings
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight Ill ease your mind
Thats why Im calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
Its hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you
Just mail me my ring back, can't keep that shit
