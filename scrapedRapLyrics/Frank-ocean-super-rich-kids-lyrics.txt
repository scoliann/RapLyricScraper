[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we cant pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents aint around enough
Too many joy rides in daddys Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
Theres nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
Well both be high, the help dont stare
They just walk by, they must dont care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we cant pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents aint around enough
Too many joy rides in daddys Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love, Im searching for a real love
Real love, Im searching for a real love
Oh, real love
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the xany-gnashing
Caddy-smashing,
bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts
Dont believe us
Treat us like we cant erupt, yup
[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want
We end our day up on the roof
I say Ill jump, I never do
But when Im drunk I act a fool
Talking bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
Im on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some dont end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
Close my eyes and feel the crash
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we cant pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents aint around enough
Too many joy rides in daddys Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love, ain't that something rare
Im searching for a real love, talking bout real love
Real love yeah
Real love
Im searching for a real love
Talking bout a real love
