[Intro]
Breathing
What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the bible too
[Hook]
Now baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)
Now baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said "where's Ricardo?"
You said "oh no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like "oh shit"
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I dont do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract if thats possible"
[Hook]
Now baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go hit the throttle with you
Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
Outro
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
