Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station, baby
Look inside these walls
And you see I'm havin' withdrawals of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's probably big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't?
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind cause one day you'll respect the good kid, m.A.A.d city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station, baby
[Verse 2]
All I see is strobe lights, blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose to persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
with the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
and your dog has to say woof
And you ask, "Lift up your shirt" cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect, the good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station, baby
[Verse 3]
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim,
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm,
inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it,
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station, baby
