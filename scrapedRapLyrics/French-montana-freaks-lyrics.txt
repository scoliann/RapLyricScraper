Freak, some gyal ah freak ah di week
Lights up the fire, you know we get higher
Rolling up loud, real niggas moving quiet
Like it then I buy it, you donkeys on a diet
Bringing all my jewels, how you know I start a riot
Riding with the bliquor, messing up her make up
Drinking out the bottle, I'm leaning with a model
I throw a hundred racks up, you think I hit the lotto
Riding with the wolves, I ain't talkin Minnesota
Shorty coming over, go and bend it over
Let me plank on it, put a drink on it
Heard you a freak, put my name on it (Montana!)
Freak, some gyal ah freak ah di week
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a

He said he met this little girl by the name of Onika
Way my body shape, all the boys wanna freak her
Brag and I boast, they be doin the most
If I look at his friend, he'll be grippin the toaster
Put my legs behind my head, I hit the ceiling with it
When I put it in his mouth I couldn't believe it
He looked me in my eyes and said he wanna breed it
Passa Passa,
you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Big fat pussy; Mufasa
Hit up Green Acres,
hit up Kings Plaza
Some of them say them gully, some of them say them gaza
Freak, some gyal ah freak ah di week
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
Freaks some gyal a freaks a di week some gyal a
