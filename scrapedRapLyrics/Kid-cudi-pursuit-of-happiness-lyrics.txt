[Intro]
Heyyy... Ratatat
Yeah!
Crush a bit, little bit
Roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling right
2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling in the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll
I'm screaming out: "Fuck that"
I'mma do just what I want
Looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die; know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die; know I lived and missed some bullets
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
Tell me what you know about dreaming, dreaming
You don't really know about nothing, nothing
Tell me what you know about them night terrors, every night
5 AM cold sweats waking up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams
Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shine ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
Instrumental
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I don't get it, I'll be good (no)
Oh, man (oh)
Room's spinning, room's spinning
Pat, Zuli...
Oh fuck
Oh my god
Why'd I go and drink so much and smoke so much
Oh.. Oh, fuck
