Dont fuck with me
I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and dont ever mean it,
we go on dates
I send the Maybach out in neighbourhoods, they never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient
I ain't lying, yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia, some fly shit
Its sitting at the house like I bought in '96
Cause honestly Im too fucking busy to drive stick
I swear, too fucking busy,
too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasnt
Been hot before they open doors for me; pre-heated oven
Im in this so, but I ain't finished though
Its been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, Im the greatest my countrys ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
That's only cause I been waiting on it,
nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga, of course
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Cant tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB,
these niggas make it so hard
To be friendly when I know part of its envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far these are empty
I take em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh, I never seen the car you claim to drive
Well, shit, I seen it, you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately it went from top 5 to remaining 5
My favorite rappers either lost it or ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down: me, Weezy and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then Ill probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me its like a high, and it wasn't a lie
Yeah, just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
