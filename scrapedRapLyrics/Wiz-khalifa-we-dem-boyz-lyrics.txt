Hol up, hol up, hol up, if you suck then swallow
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow
Throwin money on her like she won the lotto
Pussy must be serious
Hol up, Scared of heights come face your fears
Do it just like Nicki gon' and bend it over
Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner
Young nigga but I'm ready
Oh, foreign girls call me sexy
And white girls gimme becky
But first I gotta roll this joint, baby hol' up

Leave the club these hoes be tryin to chase me
You got a ass so fat lets make a baby
Damn, I'm smokin weed in my Mercedes

Man they money slim, they actin shady

Ho, bitch you ain't call my phone so why you showin up

Man on the low all these hoes be actin so material
Hol up, man did you see her interior
