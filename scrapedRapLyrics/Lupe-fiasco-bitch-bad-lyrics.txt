Yeah, I say, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four
Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
"Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!
Somethin' that's far above average."
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama
 comma
And because she's relatin' to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health,
he may skew respect for dishonor
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
They misunderstood
They misunderstood
[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls 9 through 12
On the Internet watching videos
Listening to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
"Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches."
Now, let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens:
high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Disclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using "bitch" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sho' enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
Bad mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But bad mean bad to him, bitch don't play a part
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch; what a double entendre!
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Tell 'em, bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
You're misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, greatest motherhood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
