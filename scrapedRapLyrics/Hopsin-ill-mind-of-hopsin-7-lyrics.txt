It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Life is a tour, I sit and ride along
Taking some notes and then I write the song
Im staring down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong?
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?
My mental state is fucking me up
And I cry the pond while asking you for some answers
But we dont have that type of bond
That my desires gone with the way that Ive been living lately
If I died right now, youd turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout
Cause I hopped on Christianity so strongly then I fell out
Now Im avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feeling so damn humiliated because they looking at me like Im hellbound
What story should I tell now? Ill just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to you
But who the fuck are You? You never showed the proof
And Im only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do?
Theres way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Begging all fucking men and women to listen
I cant even beat my dick without getting convicted
These aint wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I've been itching to get it, Ive been given assistance
But the whole fucking system is twisted
Now Im dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And Ive been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I cant buy it, its just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer and humans cant provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
Its truly mind blowing, I cant deny it
Is heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?
Wheres the Holy Ghost at? How longs it take a man to find it?
My minds a nonstop tape playing and I cant rewind it
You gave me a Bible and expect me not to analyze it?
Im frustrated and you provoked it
Im not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it
I have a fucking brain, you should know it
You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
Cause humans be lying, we're such an inaccurate source
Its gon be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovahs Witness to come on my porch
I swear Im slammin the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but Im not surprised
Humans are fucking dumb, still thinking that Pacs alive
I aint trying to take your legacy and torch it down
Im just saying: I aint heard shit from the horses mouth
Just sheep always telling stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now Im supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise
Sounds like a fucking Poltergeist
Show yourself and then boom it's done
Every rumors gone, I no longer doubt this shit, youre the One
Ill admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge
Ill donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club, instead of bitches Id hang with a group of nuns
And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of You
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You havent been chatting with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I aint seen no fucking talking snake unravel from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I dont know if you do or dont exist, it is driving me crazy
Send your condolences, this is me reaching to you so dont forget
If hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
Imma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feeling says its all fake
I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith
This isnt a small phase, my perspectives all changed
My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If you arent real then all my prayers arent worth a cent
That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is
And I could sit in church and say fuck in the services
Man what if Jesus was a facade?
Then that would mean the governments god
I feel like theyve been brainwashing us with a lot
So much that we dont even notice that were stuck in the box
Man everything is what if?, why is it always what if?
Planet Earth what if?, the universe what if?
My sacrifice what if!, my afterlife what if!
Every fucking thing that deals with you is fucking suspect
Im fucking done, Im fucking done
This is my fucking life and Im living it, Im having fun
If you really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully
But Ill be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isnt even guaranteed
We are you, and youre us, stop playing games
My lifes all I got, and heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I am in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
Do as you please, and Ill just do me
Im a human, Ill stay in my lane
Ill mind
It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
