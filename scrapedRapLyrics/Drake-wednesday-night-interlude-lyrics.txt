Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit aint my fault, girl cause I'm lonely
Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when Im lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When Im lonely, when Im lonely
Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebodys yacht, that you didnt buy
Youre young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, Im not here to judge
Fuck it, Im not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae
But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when Im lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When Im lonely, when Im lonely
[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
This shit aint my fault
