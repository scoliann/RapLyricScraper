Now everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up! Look, look
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
The Free World got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1Pac,
2Pac,
3Pac, 4
4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pac, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white, I am a fuckin' bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in the leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, "Fuck the free world!"
And never try and judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook  that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg, you embarrased?
This guy is a gangsta? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy dont wanna battle, he's shook
Cause ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fucking yearbook,
fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer!
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash, I say it proudly
Fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here  tell these people something they dont know about me
