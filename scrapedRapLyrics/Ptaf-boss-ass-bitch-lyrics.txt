You can suck a dick, I'm all about fame
Fuck a nigga, fuck a bitch, straight getting paid
I love money. That's all I gotta say
You say "Fuck love", I say "hey"
Nigga, fall back. I'm made for the game
Bitch, shut the fuck up and scream my name
While I run up on these hoes in this fat ass ring
I seen a bum, so I gave him change
And I seen yo nigga and he gave me brain
I step in the function and he bang my name
I'm so turnt up, I'm insane

Yo girl seventeen and I got that green
Bitches hate me cause I'm acting
Yo nigga went down and gave me the ring

If you use your tongue, I'mma like that
Pin my arms on the bed, I won't fight back
I put my tongue on your neck, how you like that?
When you go deeper, cat scratch
Before you eat the pussy, you gonna bite my neck
Bend me over the bed

Head game crazy, got me screaming his name
TinyFameSix from a swagged out game

Swagged the fuck out and we stay turnt up
Clearly, um, I don't give a fuck
Itches? All mamas, we can scrabble up
Bitches say he know me cause I'm thick
We can scrabble up these hands, you can get
So all you bitches get off my tip
Cause I'm a boss ass bitch

A pretty ass bitch with a pretty ass face
Got ya nigga fantasizing about my pussy
Got ya nigga going, going insane
