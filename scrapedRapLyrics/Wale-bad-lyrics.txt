Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it
[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
Cause I heard you (bad nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love yah
But to kiss them is saying you mean that (bad nooo)
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope
Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, mo-tion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone fore the morn', hold up

Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard your winter time cold shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games nevermind cause they all lose
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at,
nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent
Cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah
Called in the morning, cell number wasn't on, goddamn
