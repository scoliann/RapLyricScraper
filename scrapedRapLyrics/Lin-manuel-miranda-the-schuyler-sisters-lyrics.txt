[BURR]
Theres nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
His daughters
Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Work, work!
[ANGELICA]
[ELIZA]
[PEGGY]
And Peggy!
The Schuyler sisters!
Daddy said to be home by sundown
[ANGELICA]
Daddy doesnt need to know

[PEGGY]
Daddy said not to go downtown

[ELIZA]
Like I said, youre free to go
look around, look around,
New York
Its bad enough daddy wants to go to war
[ELIZA]
People shouting in the square

[PEGGY]
Its bad enough therell be violence on our shore

[ANGELICA]
New ideas in the air
Look around, look around
Shes lookin for me!
Eliza, Im lookin for a mind at work
Im lookin for a mind at work!
Im lookin for a mind at work!
Wooh! Theres nothin like summer in the city
Someone in a rush next to someone lookin pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know its not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddys got money
Why you slummin in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?
[ANGELICA]
Burr, you disgust me
[BURR]
Ah, so youve discussed me
Im a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!
Ive been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that Im intense or Im insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/PEGGY]
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal

[ANGELICA]
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson

[COMPANY]
Unh!

[ANGELICA]
Im a compel him to include women in the sequel!

[WOMEN]
Work!
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now!
History is happening in Manhattan and we just happen to be
In the greatest city in the world!
In the greatest city in the world!
[ANGELICA]
Cuz Ive been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that Im intense or Im insane

[ANGELICA]
You want a revolution?
I want a revelation
We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
