Dooo! Boy you got me
Hey hey hey hey

Hey hey hey
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the skys the limit Im helpless!
Down for the count, and Im drownin in em
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin at my sister as shes dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went Boom!
Tryin to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybodys dancin and the bands top volume
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, Yo, this
Ones mine.
My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking Whats she gonna do?
She grabbed you by the arm, Im thinkin Im through
Then you look back at me
suddenly Im
Helpless!
Oh, look at those eyes
Im so into you
I am so into you
I know Im down for the count
And Im drownin in em.
Oooh

Oooh

Oooh

Oooh
Look into your eyes
And the skys the limit
Im
Helpless!
Down for the count
And Im drownin in em
Look into your eyes
And the skys the limit Im helpless!

Down for the count
And Im drownin in em.
Im about to change your life
Then by all means, lead the way
Schuyler?
Thank you for all your service
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it
Ill leave you to it
One week later
Im writin a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
Im just sayin, if you really loved me, you would share him
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin
My fathers stone-faced
While youre asking for his blessin
You wine
And dine
And Im tryin not to cry
cause theres nothing that your mind cant do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
were through
But then he shakes your hand and says
Be true
Hoo!



That boy is mine
That boy is mine!
Oooh


Oooh

Oooh


Oooh
skys the
Limit
Down for the count
And Im drownin in
em Im
Helpless!
[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I dont have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I haves my honor,
a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits
top-notch brain
Insane,
Peggy confides in me,
Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress,
my love for you is never in doubt
Well get a little place in Harlem and well figure it out
Ive been livin without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But Ill never forget my mothers face, that was real
And long as Im alive, Eliza, swear to God
Youll never feel so
My life is gon be fine cuz Elizas in it.
I do I do I do I do!
Wedding march plays
In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
Helpless
