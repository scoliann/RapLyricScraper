British Admiral Howes got troops on the water
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbor
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbor
When they surround our troops!
They surround our troops!
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbor
As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to
Rise up!
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or
But theres only one man
Who can give us a command so we can

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up!

[HAMILTON]
Understand? Its the only way to

[HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Rise up! Rise up!
Here he comes!
Here comes the General!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The moment youve been waiting for!
The pride of Mount Vernon!
George Washington
[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned
Ayo, Im gonna need a right-hand man.
What?
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!
[WASHINGTON]
Check it
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now Im the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin letters to relatives
Embellishin my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face
the British cannons go
Boom
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people Im
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
Incoming!
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!
Theyre battering down the Battery
check the damages
Rah!
We gotta stop em and rob em of their advantages
[HAMILTON]
God
Hamilton wont abandon ship
Yo, lets steal their cannons
Shh-boom!
Boom!
[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon,
watch the blood and the shit spray and
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon,
were abandonin Kips Bay and
We just lost the southern tip and
We gotta run to Harlem quick,
we cant afford another slip
horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces
theyre skittish as the British cut the city up
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
Im in dire need of assistance
sir
[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
[WASHINGTON]
As you were
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance
Huh
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west
Yes?
Well

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?
We keep meeting
[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?
Close the door on your way out
Your reputation precedes you,
but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!
Dont get me wrong, youre a young man of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and
Henry Knox wanted to hire you
To be their Secretary? I dont think so
Whyre you upset?

[HAMILTON]
Im not

[WASHINGTON]
Its alright, you want to fight, youve got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder
Why are you telling me this?
Im being honest
Im working with a third of what our Congress has promised
So?
[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwin away my shot!
I am not throwin away my shot!
Ayo, Im just like my country, Im young
Scrappy and hungry!

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
Son
We are outgunned, outmanned!
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette,
Well need some spies on the inside
Some Kings men who might let some things slide
Ill write to Congress and tell em we need supplies,
rally the guys
rise

Ill rise above my station, organize your information, til we rise to the occasion of our new nation.
Rise up!
Rise up!
Rise up!
Boom!
Here comes the General!
What?
And his right hand man!
Boom!
