I just broke up with my ex
Now Im out here single, I dont really know whats next
But I aint even trippin', I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right and the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex
You're the one Im feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I dont normally say this but goddamn, you're the best, best, best
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I say, "Girl, you need a hot boy"
She say, "you need to stop fuckin' with them thots, boy"
I say you need a real nigga she said yes Lord
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac, shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing
She lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change
My name change from Lil Wayne to Oooh Wayne
Oh Lord, she grinding on this Grande
Oh Lord, I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that nigga, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love
She says she single and I'm her feature, oh my God
Tunechi, Mula baby
