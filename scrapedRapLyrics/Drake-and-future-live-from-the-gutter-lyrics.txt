Hendrix yeah
I woke up like this
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch
I ain't talking about some big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch
Reporting live from the gutter
I'll buy these motherfuckers talking big money shit bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears still falling down on my last bitch
This money made me hungry I'm a savage
I've seen the stars lining up you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ah
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ah
Cuban links hanging on my wrist I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see heron everywhere,
I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean I ain't started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean my nigga still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that will keep it real yeah
Got a lot of pretty bitches I just paid their bills now
Money make her feel good but damn she make me feel good
Known for getting that guala out in Europe but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch
I ain't talkin' about some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money bitch
Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It's not even a discussion
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gonna end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her tripping off of yay, yay
Pillow talking, dishing out on all y'all
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take whats coming
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks
And we gonna miss you
They dont want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through
And I'm...
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch
I ain't talking about some big money shit
Reporting live from the damn gutter
Swear to god I will buy this motherfucker, ah
