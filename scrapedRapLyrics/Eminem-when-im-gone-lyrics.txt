[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess
[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
I don't know, go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog
then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me,
but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby
[Hook]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine"
She's piling boxes in front of the door, trying to block it
"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy  no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it withcha"
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cause man, I can hear 'em
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right"  and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door,
it turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on, and I'm singing
[Hook]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
[Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy it's me!
Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you Daddy
, you told me that you weren't leavin'
"You lied to me, Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
"That's all I wanted, I just wanted to give you this coin"
"I get the point  fine, me and Mommy are goin'"
But baby, wait, "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice. Now go up there and
show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep screamin' your name.
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill,
yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word,
k-keep it real"
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes. The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin'
There's birds singin',
it's Spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to
[Hook]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
*Curtains Closing*
