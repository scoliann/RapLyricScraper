You know a lot of girls be
Thinking my songs are about them, but
This is not to get confused, this one's for you
[Hook]
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fucking
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there
(Yup)
I be hitting all the spots that you ain't even know was there
Sweatpants, hair tied, chilling with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fucking
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
Magazine paper girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there repping like a mascot
All up in your slot 'til the nigga hit the jackpot
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fucking best
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money,
