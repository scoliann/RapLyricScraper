And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
That booty talkin' to me, what that shit say?
Shake it for the dojo I'm the sensei
When she wobble with my song on replay
Almost got her a house up off Kings Way
I told her shake it like a red-nose pitbull
And I'm-a keep throwin money 'til your bank full
Cake-cake-cake-cake, birthday suit
Damn in a little I'm-a forget your age soon
Whoa, OK, now let's do it my way
If she don't go crazy then she walkin' on the highway
And if she don't believe me tell that bitch just try me
Bet you she be shakin' from the club back to my place, whoa
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
I told her time to go to work, clock in
Go on open up, I'm a locksmith
West Side, tell them other people stop it
I'm fly, and that's why she headed to the cockpit
Black Money Sage, whoadie I'mma winner
I just play 'em like a game I don't press enter
I'm hella raw: listen to the way I did her
I was in her and her nigga was there makin' dinner
Uh, all this money start movin' and I'm-a throw it
Black Money we take 'em in and then quit it
We shake 'em and if she like me it's nothin, ok
Party hard, party hard with no party fouls
Couple girls in the back wit' some party mouths
Cave her back in, then turn the party out
Shake it like a red nose, time to let 'em out, whoa
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
All this money on me
All she tryna do is get naked, naked, naked, naked
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
