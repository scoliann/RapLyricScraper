They say what goes around comes around
And I know I made mistakes and you forgave me how
I don't understand, you know I'm trying the best I can
I guess it's consequences when you dealing with sin
And even sacrificed your friends over me
All them nights in the club turn to nights with me
It's like the same old story out your diary
Memories never fade but only in time we'll see
Hope to see you with me cause...
[Hook: Chris Brown]
Grippin' and biting,
Now I'm pullin your hair told you take it
A couple of shots, now we faded
Don't even know we made it,
Got that look in your eyes like hope you mine
You get lonely when I'm touring just hold it down be supportive
I'll be back in the morning that new purse you wanted
And what's real love if you ain't got respect?
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make, make you understand
[Hook: Chris Brown]
Rolex and vest time,
Mot it's sex time
