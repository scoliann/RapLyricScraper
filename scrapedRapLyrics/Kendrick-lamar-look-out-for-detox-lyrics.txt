[Intro]
Uh, shoutout to ScHoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker (laughs)
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts Im a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC Oh my God you gotta see
Theres never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey,
Im a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
Im so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I dont care where ya are
Just blink twice and Im there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark,
you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock
like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry,
bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You aint been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
Its gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire,
Hiiipower HP,
in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
Imma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause Im going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They dont wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free Js put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although Im in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit,
when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Get it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
Im being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And a medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
Im at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, hes slumped over
And if I'm off beat know Im un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year
and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, Im a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
Im a factor
and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastors like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!
