Yeah, yeah, we gon' stay trippy for life, mane
Yeah, I'm 'bout to take yo' girl
(bounce it)
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
Im about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
Im about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
Im about to throw a couple thousand
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands
Grabbing ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick, I was thinking different
Clap that ass,
light our blunt, baby,
lets get ig'nant
Shes strips for the Gs,
rake cash like leaves
She got double Ds, and aint shit free
Came with my goons but Im leaving with a diva
With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She aint finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncing ass while Im getting high as propellers on a helicopter
me, you and your friend
We dont even need a room, give me head up in my Benz
Where my double cup, time to pour it up
Got a bitch so bad you cant afford to fuck
Bounce it
(Wale though, le'go)
Hands is on her you know what
Cause bandz a make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast
My pants be on that too much lust
And Im bout whatever baby, take a photo,
Im looking good
And these breezies are so beneath you,
understand youre misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
Over these pussy niggas, only under influence
Throw a block up then I back out, like that
Roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick Ima smack
And a bucket but we nothing but tatted
Bald-headed scallywags
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Marc Gasol, or Selby do
thats plenty dough
Thats Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those
Ralph!
[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Turn up
Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy
Toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl
Do a Montana line off of her titty
Aint trying to fuck, I just found a replacement
Feeling so global, I think I need Asian
Ratchet on deck and they know Im gon stunt
Im trying to get head while smoking a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up
I dont know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie
Then codeine in a Styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they popping
Do it real good, might take you shopping
All these racks cant fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking
Then its back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I dont buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check
Working for that money, bitch, you gon have to break a sweat
Im about to throw a couple thousand
Im about to throw a couple thousand
