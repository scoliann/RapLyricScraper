[Verse 1: King Chip]
I'm just what you made God
- not many I trust
I'mma go my own way, God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryin' to get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning,
I'm wakin' bakin',
drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush,
that big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on" she said, "Naw, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin',
straight swaggin',
lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing,
make sure keep that fire blazin',
we livin'
[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God
(Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God
Let me tell you bout my month y'all, endless shopping, I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink dont think that helps at all
Whatever, that man aint wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills aint working fam
In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life youd understand
But, I cant fold, some poor soul got it way worse
Were all troubled, in a world of trouble
Its scary to have a kid walk this Earth
Im what you made God, fuck yes Im so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who werent my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours,
whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sanes a chore,
amidst a dream with no exit doors
Need it to get by, ya
Willy
