Ladies, it's your song,
so as soon as this come on
You should get out on the floor,
go and get your sexy on
If you know that you're better than the new girl that he on
Go 'head and tell him now, "You gon' miss me when I'm gone"
Aye yo, CiCi
Let me show you how to do a singing bitch greasy
You was by Lenox, yeah, the one on Peachtree
I was with Dimitri
Seen you on your Love & Hip Hop, Mendecees
"F-f-f-fuck these petty niggas" is a bitch motto
If I say it on wax, every bitch follow
If I'm sipping in the club, Myx Moscato
I got a big fat ass, big dicks follow
Hit them with the back shots, hit them with the ass shots
Take them to the bank then I hit them with the cash drops
I do it big, I hit them with the caps lock
I'm gonna ball, I hit them with the mascot
No, I never been there, but I like to Bangkok
Big fat titties when they hanging out my tank top
Huh, you gon' play me? On Instagram, niggas trying to shade me
But your bitch at home trying to play me,
I'm Nicki M Weezy F, baby
Man, fuck you and your lady,
gun butt you, cause you're shady
Now which bitch want it, cause that bitch get it
I gave him to you, bitch, don't fucking forget it
I just went through a break up
But it's okay, I got my cake up
Do my hair, put on some makeup (Ooh yeah-yeah-yeah)
Trying to see where tonight gonna take us (Ooh yeah-yeah-yeah)
I post some pics up looking sexy (Ooh yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now this nigga wanna text me (Ooh yeah-yeah-yeah)
How much you wanna bet me?
He gonna regret the day he left me
Celebratin' our breakin' up, oh whoa
Let's have a toast to our goodbyes, oh whoa
Now tell me, do my ladies run this
Not even Hammer can touch this
This is what you hearin' through your speakers
That's why we dancin' til our feet hurt (Ooh yeah-yeah-yeah)
The way I put it on you got you goin' trippy, trippy (whoa)
You wanna come for it, wishin' you could get it, get it
{Ladies, it's your song, so as soon as this come on}
Say "fuck these petty niggas" if these niggas did you wrong
If he got a new bitch, then tell that bitch meet you outside
And pop her like a molly 'til them bitches recognize
Grinning (I'm out)
I'm winning -
the end and the beginning
You couldn't get a fan if it was hanging from the ceiling
