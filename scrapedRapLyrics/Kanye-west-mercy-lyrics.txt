[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]
Well! It is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weepin' and a mournin' and a gnashing of teeth
It is a, when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe, believe, believe
[Hook: YB + (Big Sean)]

She tryna jerk me

[Verse 1: Big Sean + (Kanye West)]
Okay, drop it to the floor, make that ass shake
Whoa, make the ground move, that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass,
that's an ass-tate
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye don't we do this every day-day? (haaaan?)
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day (haaaan?)
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
(And niggas still hatin'), so much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'
White girls politickin', that's that Sarah Palin
Gettin' hot, Californicatin'
I give her that D, cause that's where I was born and raised in

[Interlude: Fuzzy Jones]
Well! It is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashing of teeth

Believe, believe, believe
[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yuugh!
It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill poppin'-ass ho
I'm poppin' too,
these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money, all she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out, I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist, them heads turnin', that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras, that's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two-door preference, roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake so your Duncan Hines is irrelevant
Woo! Lambo, Murcie-lago
She go wherever I go, wherever we go, we do it pronto

[Interlude: Fuzzy Jones]
Well, it is a weepin' and a mournin' and a gnashing of teeth in the dancehall
And who no have teeth gwan rub pon them gums
Cause when time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound
The bugle has blown fi many times, and it still have one more time left
Cause the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em give me fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary,
she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dal
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans
[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time, drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Tell em!)
Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a Band-Aid
Grade A, A1,
chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds,
backpack rhymin', co-signed by Louis Vuitton
Horsepower, horsepower, all this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand,
I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin', all my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign
money tall like Jordan
