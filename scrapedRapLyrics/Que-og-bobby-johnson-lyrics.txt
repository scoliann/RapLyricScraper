You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson Beat
[Hook]
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Hangin' with the killers in the projects
Potato on the barrel keep quiet (shh)
Catch a nigga slippin' from behind (boom)
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
Wipe a nigga out like an outbreak
Choppa start bustin' make the house shake
Fuck niggas sweeter than a pound cake
Get your eyes on your chin better watch what your mouth say
Lean with the footballs got a nigga trippin' (Xans)
Fuck it, fuck it, nigga keep sippin'
Dirty AK with the beam on it
Clip so long I could lean on it
Free my niggas locked behind bars
Moved a hundred pounds before a lawyer beat the charge (beat it)
Pack touchdown run it back like Marshall Faulk
If a nigga try to rob, fuck it, hit em wit the hawk (boom)
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Hangin' with the killers in the projects
Potato on the barrel keep quiet (shh)
Catch a nigga slippin' from behind (boom)
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
Hundred bands on your head get the job done
Throw it up, throw it up, nigga where ya from?
Whole hood hot cause ya nigga hittin' licks
Ain't made a mil yet but it's still nigga rich
Stick em up, stick em up, stick em (stick em up)
How ya want it nigga? Full or the semi
Lurkin' for the cash, searchin' for the bag
Young nigga wildin', throwin' up flags
Shooters on the roof with a scope (boom boom)
Money make em treat ya like the pope (like a king!)
Work the block like Dikembe in the post (cook 'em up)
Nigga hit it with the fork (hit it)
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Hangin' with the killers in the projects
Potato on the barrel keep quiet (shh)
Catch a nigga slippin' from behind (boom)
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
It's the niggas that you trust that'll prolly turn feds
Hatin' on ya heart cuz you rockin' Hermes
Especially if ya money long, guarantee you turn heads
Ray Ray'll sell it all
gotta watch the shermheads
Hate, hate, hate (hate), jealousy is a bitch nigga trait
These niggas snakes wanna know what ya make
Grimy ass ho, do ya like Larenz Tate (Caine)
Young nigga runnin' with the cannon
Never let a nigga see ya panic
Dope boys in the hood workin' with the Hispanics
On the phone with the plug, nigga speakin' Spanish
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Hangin' with the killers in the projects
Potato on the barrel keep quiet (shh)
Catch a nigga slippin' from behind (boom)
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
