Where were you when I needed you eight months ago?
All your girlfriends talkin' bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
I bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby, I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right
[Hook]
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song
And now I'm poppin' yea
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin' yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you girl
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin' in the club
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby, I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right
[Hook]
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song
[Outro: Juicy J]
Listen to that shit, man
The Weeknd music make the ladies panties get wet!
Jam that shit my nigga
I'm high as a motherfucker
I don't give a shit
I'm going to the strip club
I'm throwing 30 thousand dollars nigga, 30 thousand!
Fuck that shit
Spend that shit nigga, it's Christmas!
Shutthefuckup!
We trippy mane!
