YOUNG MULA BAAAAY-BAY!
Haha, you thought it was over?
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes aint right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she aint have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, thats that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time,
Im the shit
Nigga, thats that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes aint loyal
These hoes aint loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke niggas bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I dont fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up the Bob Marley Im a Rasta
She wanna do drugs (drugs) smoke weed, get drunk (wasted)
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers (uh-huh)
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, lets get to it, right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
Thats a no-no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance
[Verse 4: French Montana]
HAH! Once Cirocs in the system
Aint no telling will I fuck them, will I diss them
Thats what they be yelling, Im a pimp by blood
Not relation, I dont chase em, I replace em
(HANNNN!)
LVs, Hermes, Dolces
Them hoes, aint loyal, man, they rotate
School me to the game, now I know my duty
Put her in the Lotus
She was riding in that hoopty (WHOOP!)
Fuck that bitch
I got my own ho
Fuck your weed
I got my own smoke
Had to put my mink back on
Tell that bitch, put her ring back on
Montana
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin?
Baby show me something
You done spent your bread on her
And its all for nothing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
