And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now its gone
Lets leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
Same city, yeah, we cant break up
Nice mask on, I wore the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment  whats the matter?
Shes learning that she never should have dated a rapper
I dont blame her, my mind is gone
Im at dinner, checking phone calls, texts and blogs
I dont hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs
Goes on and on
Dont wanna break you, but Im leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now its gone
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now its gone
Lets leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
Its over, over
Didnt believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now Im on the homies couch
Always going out, sleeping round with strangers
Danger! But you cant live without her
Now youre paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she aint like you alone
Havent made love with the lights still on
Its like youre hiding something from me
Lets fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy of me husband and you wife
Lyin, staring into those two eyes
And I cant take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, lets keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love  maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to god, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and gettin' my heart thawed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed off shotgun at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with a complimentary toothpaste
Lately, Ive been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that Im leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and its so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it
Cant get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
Cant get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
