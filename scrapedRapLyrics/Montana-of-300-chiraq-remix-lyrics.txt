Any nigga that ever looked at me wrong, (ha!) hey man, go that way B
Hey, man, I'm done holdin' back on you niggas, man, straight up, man
Y'all niggas better to go watch Montana 300 1 through 14 or something man, this 15
I been ballin
Could've skipped college
I'm a bad boy with that big popper
12 gauge when I head shot him
Bust his head open like a pinata
Like Percy Miller I've been bout it
Come find your ass like Bin Laden
I kill a clown over my guala
Don't give a fuck if it was 10 dollars
Don't trust niggas don't trust bitches
I know these ho's like a pimp scholar
And it's MOB till the day I drop
And these stupid thots don't get nada
And these dick riders try to steal from me
Gon feel the heat when that lead pop em
I whack a bitch and then walk away with blood on my shoes that's red bottoms
Bought a new gun with two clips
I can't wait to use it
And that bitch stick to my hip like I glued it
I hope you do trip as soon as you do it
I'll pull that bitch out K-9 unit
And kiss your ass goodnight, like, (bang bang) that's smooches
No top that's clueless
I'm ruthless, I do this
I'm ballin these ho's, yeah, they all on my pool stick
And you mad at your main bitch cause that bitch bumpin my new shit
Yeah the game foul and the ref dirty
Keep the green on me like a jets jersey
Tell a opposition I ain't never worried
Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
I can see you pussy like a miniskirt
Keep talkin you gon get it first
And the toughest with you gon' get it worst
Now go order up about 20 shirts
RIP with they face on it,
have to show they ass how that semi work
Yeah they got smoked April 21st
The next time you see 'em gon' be in a hearse
Always sayin somethin' but ain't sprayin nothin'
When it's beef I don't wait for nothin'
If I see a opp broad day in public
Then I'm shootin shit like Azae Production
Got word they be out there every night
I'm talking deeper than Barry White
We gon' ride past with that iron blast
And start flipping niggas like Jessie White
They catching bullets, he Randy Moss, he Terrell Owens, he Jerry Rice
And I'm fucking monster in a pair of Mike's and this 40 on me looks very nice
I roll up like a blunt,
I don't lurk bitch I hunt
Hoodie on like a monk,
I'm Boyz-N-Tha-Hood with that pump
This bitch got kicked like a punt
it usually sit in my trunk
But for today it's riding shotgun since niggas like to front
And if this nigga run and this nigga done, I'ma soak a nigga like he in the tub
These rappers acting like Ice Cube now tell Doughboy to come pick him up
Fuck niggas I never like 'em, got no problem with killin' one
I do real hits and don't brag about it, just rap about it, I don't give a fuck
I remember way back when we was broke, we was crying, momma high as hell
To us she was a loving mother but to other motherfuckers she was clientele
And I remember begging her to stop and every single night when I told her that
I'ma get big and buy a bunch of guns
And kill every nigga that done sold her crack
It's almost 20 years later, now she finally sober
But that was the shit that I prayed about
I thank God I made it out
Damn it feels good to go pick up my momma and take her out
Lil Tony got paper now all in my bank account
and it ain't shit to debate about
If you cross me like Jesus, I'll come back with heaters
Be outside your crib like we stakin' out
It's really fucked up in my city I'm sorry but I'm bout to add to the body count
I'll Rocky Part 4'em I'm rushin'
show all you niggas exactly what I be 'bout
My choppas, they shit on them bitches, when spittin, I think they might got a potty mouth
I might come baseline like Kobe Bryant, did way back in '03 and then body yall
Keep runnin' your mouth I'ma run in your house
Paramedics they gonna' bring bodies out
I'm sonin you niggas like Jay Rock
and word on the streets is that they done let Bobby out
Be strapped at the mall, strapped at the studio, you better be strapped at your momma house
When Montana hoppin' out, hollow tips poppin' out
I caught his ass takin' the garbage out
Moment of silence, text messages sent around my city, the moment they find it out
Black on black everything
We own black everything
That's the motto when we ridin' out
The ratchets stay on me, just know I was all me, whenever if ever you saw me out
Been playin' with iron, since the age of nine
Shoutout to my daddy he taught me how
My dad was a killer, my mom was an addict, a nigga grew up in a slaughterhouse
I am the one that they talk about
I am so cold that
you
might
have to
Thaw
me out
That money be callin', I'm almost stopped ballin',
now I am up next like Jabari now
See niggas was sleepin' on me, but I just woke them up and they sayin' they sorry now?
I'm a dough stacking
Dope rapping, no lacking
Po' packing, Four blasting
Soul snatching, toe tagging, cold bastard
Better close your mouth or get a closed casket
Show you what I'm saying like closed captions
Put them in two, make them disappear, when I spit fire, that's old magic
I'll put the chopper to a nigga top, and then let it fly, Go-Go Gadget
Might fuck his bitch or say fuck this shit, and get straight face, that's no passion
I'm the illest nigga that you ever heard
I'm the flyest killer that you ever seen
If a fuck nigga ever jump stupid, I'ma catch a body like a trampoline
Bitch I'm Freddy Kruger in a hockey mask
About to kick door like karate class
Ask a nigga where he hide his stash
He better tell the truth like a polygraph
One false move and that shotty blast
Leave a nigga stiff like a body cast
And we don't know nothing about nothing nigga, we was out of town If somebody ask
Real shit, I'm a father first, my son's need me, I ain't bailing on them
Be with real niggas, doing real shit
If I get caught, I ain't telling on them
No tool, I ain't never going
Iron Man with that metal on him
Only God knows where the hell I'm going
Make a nigga wish he was never born
These niggas broke, put a price on them
I'm super fly, put a cape on them
I'm upstairs up in Adrianna's throwing cake on them while they hate on them
From Chiraq, not Miami, but I'm wearing heat like I play for them
I'll come at night and put the nine on them
With the long clip
Deandre Jordan, (Deandre Jordan, Deandre Jordan)
I'll come at night and put the nine to them
With the long clip, Deandre Jordan
