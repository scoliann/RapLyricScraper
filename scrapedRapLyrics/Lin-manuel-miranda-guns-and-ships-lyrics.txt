How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving
Betsy Ross flag
higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love whos unafraid to step in!
Hes constantly confusin, confoundin the British henchmen
Evryone give it up for Americas favorite fighting Frenchman!
Lafayette!
Im takin this horse by the reins
makin
Redcoats redder with bloodstains
[LAFAYETTE]
And Im never gonna stop until I make em
Drop and burn em up and scatter their remains,

Lafayette!
Watch me engagin em! Escapin em!
Enragin em! Im
I go to France for more funds
I come back with more
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea,
but
For this to succeed, there is someone else we need:
I know
Hamilton
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French,
I mean
Hamilton!
Sir, youre gonna have to use him eventually
Whats he gonna do on the bench?
I mean
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance
You wanna fight for your land back?

[WASHINGTON]
I need my right hand man back!
[LAFAYETTE]
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back


I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers that will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
Theyll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same,
Alexander
