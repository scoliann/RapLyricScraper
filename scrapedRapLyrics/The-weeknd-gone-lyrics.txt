I got you
I got a hold of you
You said you out to see
How we roll
Well then take a seat, oh yeah
Well, take a seat
And watch your ass go
Break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it baby
Don't you worry, you gotta keep up
Cause I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone
Girl
Why don't you fuck what you heard, baby
Cause I been gone
You can see for yourself, little lady
Girl, I lit you up with something
Something something, for you
There's enough to pass around
Yeah, yeah, yea yea yea yea
Oh well just
Break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it baby
Don't you worry, don't you worry, you gotta keep up
Cause I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone
Hope I make it home
You'll be thinking of it
I got the whole city on my side, tonight, tonight
Watch us rock it out
Watch us leave the ground
After the show is done
You can take me to yours
But my lungs so muddy
I love the way it tastes
Drink it till I'm ugly baby
Fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denims
Baby girl, I gotcha
I'm only 21 so I do it when I wanna
Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feelin' kinda weak
And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit
I'mma give you what you fiend, oh
But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm fallin'
Cause I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I can win a fuckin' Oscar
By the way I fuckin' hid it
And you'll never fuckin' know
I'll never fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion
Dirty Sprite toastin'
Fast life, fuck slow
Low life for life
Let the meds flow, let the night flow
I'm so gone, let these meds flow
I'm so gone, let these meds flow
I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Woah, woah, oh
Said I'm gone, gone, gone
Woah oh
I'm so gone
Gone
