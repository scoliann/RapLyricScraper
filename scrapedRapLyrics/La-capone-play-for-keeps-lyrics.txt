Verse 1: L'A Capone
We play for keeps
The whole hood know me
No new niggas, they aint on the block
Making guap trying to feed the team
Got a motherfucking dot no circle
Big 30 hanging out, no curfew
One call,

Sneak diss, man thats gone hurt you
Oh yeah, we taking shit
Steady running from the Jakes and shit
When we reach the top
We could stop doing this basic shit
Cause Ill ride or die for my niggas
Ill get crucified for my niggas
Youll never see a one on one, fuck boy
The whole squad gone get you
These niggas so phony though
Theyll act like your homie, though
'Til they see some bands, but it aint your mans
He just bail like Romeo
And Im still by the corner store
Fuck all this rapping, bro

My OG told me to slow down

Take him down then smoke his whole pound
Ah, they deep, huh? Empty the round
Get caught but I wont make a sound
But it's dead cause Im shooting out of town
We sell green and white but no brown

These niggas aint really in the field
Little Folks going in for the kill
Late night trying to creep with the steel
Shondale, how that hot shit feel?
And I love when Im off that pill
Cant change boy Im too real
They say real niggas dont say they real
Well fuck nigga Im real
And if he cant break bread he fake
I had one more buck on my plate
It was me and bro, we was in the store
And both of us got 50 cent cake
A bitch cant tell me she late
The condoms I use dont break
We at the starting point of this race
We gone win, nigga I cant wait
Rondo'll gamble with your soul
GDK fuck a Brick

In the hood, strapped up, bunch of poles
Jakes snatch me up and you know I cant fold
600, free my nigga, D-Rose
All these hoes kind of getting too old
I aint playing no lover games with them lover gangs
Niggas get smoked
Yeah, it's a lot of shooters on my squad
Yeah, it's a lot of shooters on my squad
And if he holding on that work he get robbed
TEC on my neck, I dont need no bodyguard
These niggas be crazy
These niggas dont tote
These niggas think its a joke
Let me see an opp, I'm a blow
See a lot of niggas say I changed
Cause Rondo done made a little change
I still claim the set I claimed
And I aint going, try to take my chain
D-Block,

Steve Drive, thats my campaign
And I would never snitch, that just dont exist
Cuz, that's blood on my name
Yeah, Im a shooter bitch
Tay 600 up them rugers quick
Deadbeat pops, got raised by the block

He was probably with his moms
He was probably on the porch
Since a youngin, bitch I been that nigga
I was blowing the torch
