[Verse 1]
Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like theres coke up my asscrack
Move black girls cause, man, fuck it, Ill do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, its all about the over Es
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird, like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousins 440
Eatin Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin in the islands, lookin for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so Im callin it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
Cause Im a beast, bitch, "grrr" - Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl: fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not phase me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
You're my favorite rapper now! Yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin kiss my ass: Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I aint that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?
I dont know, all I know is Im the best one
Its a bonfire, turn the lights out
Im burnin everything you muthafuckas talk about
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
Im from the South, aint got no accent, dont know why
So this rap is childs play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit: First of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he cant even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, thats a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Owwww"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, Im in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, dont bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
Im screamin What the fuck is up? like I ain't seen the sky
The shit Im doin this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it: Casey Anthony
These rappers dont know what to do
Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Toon
And Ill give you all of me until theres nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch
