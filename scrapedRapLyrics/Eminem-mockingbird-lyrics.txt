Yeah, I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier!
Stiffen up that upper lip!
What you cryin' about? You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls, when it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
Cause Daddy felt like a bum, see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
'Til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguing a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing Daddy on the TV
And Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing, looking at your baby pictures
It just trips me out to see how much you both have grown
It's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie,
I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sssshhh! Momma's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat;
don't fuck with Dad!
Ha ha!
