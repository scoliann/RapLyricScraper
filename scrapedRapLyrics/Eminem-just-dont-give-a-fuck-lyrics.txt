[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em, and like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall!)
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming, "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck
I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin',
this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you,
smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen; hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady; Eminem was the old initials (bye bye!)
Extortion, snortin',
supportin' abortion
Pathological liar,
blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker,
compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man.
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can,
with more holes than an afghan
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming, "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck
Somebody, let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure,
I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke,
I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems
Got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming, "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck
Shit, fuck everybody
Outsidaz, Pacewon, Young Zee
(Fuck the entire world!) DU
