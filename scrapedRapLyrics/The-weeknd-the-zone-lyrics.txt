[Directed by Abel Tesfaye]
Why you rushing me baby?
Its only us, alone
I don't want to die tonight baby
So lemme sip this slow
Ill give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
Ill be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed
And I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'mma touch you right
I won't see a damn thing
I cant feel a damn thing
But I'mma touch you right
Imma touch you right (let me sip this slow)
Imma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
Imma touch you right (just let me)
And I'mma lean, till I fall, ooh yeah
And I dont give a damn
I felt the ground before
I left it all behind, baby
I didnt need no one
But Im in heat tonight baby
Ive been alone for too long
Oh, oh yeah
So, I won't say a damn thing
I cant feel a damn thing
But Ima touch you right
I cant see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But Ima touch you right
Imma touch you right (let me sip this slow)
Imma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
Imma touch you right (just let me)
[Verse 3: Drake]
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail,
got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's.. go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit yo sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
Thats that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But its all good, dont stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She dont really like attention, I dont know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah
