Damn your lips very soft
(Ouh)
As I turn my Blackberry off
(Ouh)
And I turn your bathwater on
(Ouh)
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas (Ouh)
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off
That's all dem can do (Say wah, say wah, Say wah, Say wah)
(Ouh, ahh)
That's all dem can do ( ahh)
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting, a' dat man do
Action thing yo a badman thing
[Verse 2: Assassin]
I'm a badman you if know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel say we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We agon' smile 'pon court day
Because we beat murder charge like O.J
Justin Vernon
Thats right, Im in it
(Shouldve known I would fall)
Im in it
(Steppin' on cracks on the floor)
Thats right
(And your boys at your door)
Thats right, Im in it
(Well, you need to fight for your own)
Thats right, Im in it
(Ouh)
(Then dont let me at your table (Ouh))
Im in it
(Ouh)
(If you just gonna lay there (Ouh))
Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars (Ouh)
I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!
Justin Vernon
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
That's all dem can do (say wah, say wah?, say wah, say wah?)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star fucker
Star fucker
Star fucker
[Outro: Kanye West]
Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, gettin' head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playin'
Uh, they don't see what I'm sayin'
Uh, they be ballin' in the D-League
Uh, I be speakin' Swaghili
