SEABURY
Hear ye, hear ye!
My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
This Congress does not speak for me
Let him be
[SEABURY]
Theyre playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame

Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?
