[Hook: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say "hello"
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun
and I dress to a tee
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see
the Knicks
play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what?)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend
Uh Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?
Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then jam you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?
scoobie doo
And guess what, America: we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast
To the beat beat, it's so unique
To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, uh, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three emcees
We're treacherous trio
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said "damn fly guy I'm in love with you"
The Casanova legend must have been true
Said "I go by the name of Lois Lane"
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
white Sasoons
A little rap to make you boogaloo
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
Baby but bubbah we're still friends"
I say "Hank can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo"
I said "come on, make uh, make the people move"
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme"
So from six to six 'til this very day
I got style, finesse and a little black book
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
I didn't even bite
godd--m
So the sucker emcees can bite all night
It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Cause I'mma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends
Uh, Master Gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do?
Well like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the barkay's singing holy ghost
Just like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his
super sperm
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the barkays on the mic
I got right on down to the beat you see
Getting right on down making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat, beat that makes you freak
