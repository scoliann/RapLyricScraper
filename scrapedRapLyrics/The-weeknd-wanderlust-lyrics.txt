Is it so hard to say the same thing?
And you're so weak to say the same thing
Burn a hole into your apprehensiveness
And let the wildfire shine
And repeat after me (like)
Good girls go to heaven
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you won't care
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little, Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
Don't you shy away from me
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition
I'm on your side
Don't patronize
You know tonight
Is the only time we'll have each other
Why would you try to waste this precious time?
Cuz tonight, we'll be right here
And tomorrow you won't care
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little, Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
They're in love with this idea of love
It's a shame that they'll believe it will come
For us all, for us all
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
