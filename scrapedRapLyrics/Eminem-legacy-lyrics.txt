[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go, tell me what to do, I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true, I'll say it all for you
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority
Defiant often flyin' off at the handle at my mom, no dad
So I am noncompliant at home, at school, I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trying to diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive
Talking to myself, either that or inside hiding off in
The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed
Cause I'm crying and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
Cause he said that I eye-balled him
[Pre-Hook: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll catch you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words
[Hook: Polina]
Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come,
it's mind-bogglin'
Cause I obsess on everything in my mind
Small shit bothers me,
but not my father
He said sayonara then split but I dont give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me, life offers
Why bother even trying to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of trying to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something, like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right, fight's on bitch
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic, in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest
[Hook: Polina]
Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talkin' thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fucking worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
Cause you dicks butt kiss,
bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're going to die a ball licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can suck a dick
The day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't haltin'
'til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my...
[Hook: Polina]
Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
