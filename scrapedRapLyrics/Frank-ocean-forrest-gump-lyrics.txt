I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind, boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind, boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I saw your game, Forrest
I was screaming run forty-four
But you kept running past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind, boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
Forrest green
Forrest blues
I'm remembering you
If this is love
I know it's true
I won't forget you
It's for you Forrest
It's for you Forrest
If this is love
I know it's true
I won't
For-get-you
