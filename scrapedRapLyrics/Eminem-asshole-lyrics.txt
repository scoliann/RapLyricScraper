[Verse 1]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast,
it was like I blinked  sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man, I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dishin'
but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many
People ever give a shit what I had to say,
it's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living,
put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric, I thanked you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
and battle for it
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
atta-boy
They told me to slow down, and I just zone out
Good luck trying to convince a blonde,
it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
Cause I was trying to leave, No Doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now
Because everybody knows
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
[Bridge]
Thanks for the support, asshole *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole
Quit actin' salty
I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash talkin' about
The fight was fixed
I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell but the fans caught me and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt
Word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' SHAKESpeare
So what if the insults are revolting
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles
Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto
before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo
My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowing this track whole
Better pack toilet paper
But I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there they go
Trying to dip out the back door retreating
Cause everybody knows
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Holy mackerel
I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinking we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch!
How do fucking magnets work?"
Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable
It's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen
That ain't practical
You cracking a joke, it's laughable
Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded
Full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinking you're one of a kind
Like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you was a miner
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent
Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters,
but sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther,
so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent,
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents And 'mother' fucking 'father' time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup, so now my cup has runneth over
And I'm bout to set it on you like a muthafucking coaster
Im going back to what got me here, yeah cocky
And cant knock being rude off, so fear not my dear
And dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows
