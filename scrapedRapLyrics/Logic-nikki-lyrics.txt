[Verse]
I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe Im just not as strong as I once was
When were together lately I dont even feel a buzz
Im addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go
Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind Im wondering what Im paying for
All these other bitches on my dick but I cant fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black
Tell me where you've been jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, thats what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God thats all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I cant fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man its outrageous
All I know is Im living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Dont get me wrong, cant forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs wont
I look away but my head dont
I love it when youre fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you
Nothing can replace you
I wish I could erase you, youre everywhere I go
But youre everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that dont seem to understand
Im just a man they always ask whats wrong with me
Man youre everything I crave
Youre the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
Im a king, youre my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine
Slave for the
Said Im a slave for the nicotine
Been a slave for ya
Im a muthafuckin slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine
Nikki, Nikki slave for ya
Im a slave for ya Nikki
Im a muthafuckin slave for ya
