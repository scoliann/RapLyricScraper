And the peaches and the mangos
You could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
Cotton candy
Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you
My god shes giving me pleasure
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy Majin Buu
My god giving me pleasure
Pleasure pleasure pleasure
Pleasure over matter
Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw
Shes better with some fella with a regular job
I didnt wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Im building yall a clock, stop
What am I Hemingway?
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddlin
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend
I need to hold your hand
Youd need no other man
Wed flee to other lands
[Bridge]
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
Well frankly when that ocean so muphucking good
Make her swab the muphucking wood
Make her walk the muphucking plank
Make her rob a muphucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver
