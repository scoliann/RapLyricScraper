Young Nino, fuck a bitch in a peacoat
Carlito, Scarface, Al Pacino
Bun B though, Pimp C, R.I.P though
I goes deep in that pussy: Dan Marino
She wanna be the one, fuck her to my own single
Break a bitch heart,
no future: Miss Cleo
Snapback, au-au-automatic reload
Flyer than a fucking beetle
you cant beat em
Vampire fuck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch
leave you in the cement
Dont believe it
stripe like A-fucking-didas
The gun Selena, give a nigga Bieber fever
Real fucking hot, put it in park
Take a shot,
higher than a tube sock
You's a bop, give me top top, as I load the whop
Man these niggas say Im fly but to her Im God
Im faded faded faded
My nigga, Im faded faded faded
And I dont give a fuck
Fuck is up, niggas stomping in my Chucks
Yeah I make it reindeer, cause Im all about my bucks
Use the butt up in the front, dick up in her cunt
And I put it in her hole, hole-in-one, putt putt
S-Super McNasty, why you McLovin
When the bitch call me daddy
Pimp, no Caddy
She wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog, called the bitch Lassie
bang her like Cincinnati
Above average, f-fly like Im Aladdin
They bend backwards, throw the pussy at them
Im Ben Wallace, dunk up in your basket
Balls in the air
No games, Im serious, double dare
Theres too many bitches, why these niggas wanna stare
Pat Ron up in here, nigga this aint no beer
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, Magic Johnson
My motherfucking doctor said I need a doctor
So I called House, now I am a pill popper
Faded like skinnys, Young Money we winning
I told her if I change, she wont get a penny
Milking this shit, pregnant bitch titties
Bringing home the bacon, Im fucking Miss Piggy
Loaded like a semi, send me naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call that nigga Richard
Prior to me coming, I had to stick my thumb in
Her ass one time, smell my finger make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet
The shoe fit: I worn it
She tried to jack me off
Cant beat it, join it
Tunechi, coochie, that what she call it
Flag scarlet, I killed it, mourning
