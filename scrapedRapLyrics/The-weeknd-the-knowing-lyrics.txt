I know what you did
I know
So I'mma let you taste her
I ain't washing my sins
I ain't washing my sins
Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding all it behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay
I swear it's okay
Cause I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
Now these tongues don't twist like they did before
It's hard to keep me up
And you are dry
But baby it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you the merrier
Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay
It's okay
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
