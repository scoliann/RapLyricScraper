[Produced by Childish Gambino, Ludwig Gransson, & Sam Spiegel]
When we were coming down, they said it was too soon
I never had to lie, no, no, no, no
When we were coming down, they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere,
I know you've been around
I feel you in and out, how are you?
Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken, now everything is broken
I'm a good son, you're a good son
You're a good son (x3)
[Beat Switch]
Free information, free information
Free information, free informa-ma
[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Arlanda, hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can vibe out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke, and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke
and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though...
How old are you,
saying that you never date older dudes?
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his goose
"I'ma walk out; wanna walk too?"
What about dude?
"Fuck him, I just really wanna feel something"
[Bridge: Kilo
Kish]
It took me like five minutes to figure out
What voices those were, on the phone
But I figured it out...
[Hook: Kilo Kish]
Is it real, cause you're online? (x4)
I'm a freaky bitch
I am 5 foot 8, 390
And I am a freaky bitch
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Heathen,
it's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic,
puff puff pass addict
Craftmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Grind cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost God, never prayed, forgotten us
Lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait until I'm walking in it
With a gun that they 3D printed and finish it
Kinison said if you gonna miss heaven...
Why do it by two inches?
Old money and new bitches
Getting next level in a hotel
Aint shit that we dont need
Nigga oh well
