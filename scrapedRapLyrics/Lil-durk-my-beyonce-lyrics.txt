Ooh I like the way she move
Shawty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby I know they so confused
Shawty my Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Shawty my Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
My Beyonc
Trippin' on that drank, but I know she worth it
Independent baby, I know she workin'
Adriana's serving drinks, 20 bottles, urgent
I know it can be better but nobody's perfect
We flirted for a minute, DeJ, that's my baby
I ain't trippin', I'm like Henny, yeah I'm in her kidneys
She like to play her songs to the way I'm hittin' it
Turn around like, "Damn Durk I like the way you hittin' it"
Don't believe the rumors, girl
You know I'll do you, girl
I don't wanna hear the shit about the niggas
That tried to do you, girl
Fuck the past right now
Shawty got you right now
And you hot right now
You can get it right now, baby
Ooh I like the way she move
Shawty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby I know they so confused
Shawty my Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Shawty my Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
My Beyonc
[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
I let him get it when he want it, knock it down and push up on it
I was plottin' for a while, now I got him where I want him
They didn't understand none of this was planned
99 problems but a bitch better not be none
Na na, na na, yeah yeah
This ain't what he want, I told him that
Leave your girl, be through with that
Get with DeJ, he ain't ever goin' back
He was shy when I seen him, now he smile
Heard a few rumors but they ain't my style
I be hatin' when he out of town
Hotel, I FaceTime you, no towel
They ain't get it but they ain't our problem
What the fuck can they do about it?
Durk and DeJ
I'm thinkin' 'bout changin' my last name
Ooh I like the way she move
Shawty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby I know they so confused
Shawty my Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Shawty my Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
My Beyonc
You and I
White dress, flowers, and a suit and tie
Me and you like Bonnie and Clyde
No beat the case, we're do or die
Who am I to say you ain't natural?
Your haters my haters, ain't switchin' up, baby, I got you
I'm with her like a tattoo
The way you wear that dress, they gon' attack you
The way you look at me, baby I got you
I hit it from the front, I like the back too
She say, "Lay down so I can ride you"
I know that she feinding
She scratchin' my back, I like how she screamin'
I fuck her and leave her, she feinding
Shawty my Beyonc
Ooh I like the way she move
Shawty my baby, my everything, she the truth
Together we cool, me and her can't lose
Keep 'em on their feet, baby I know they so confused
Shawty my Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Shawty my Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
My Beyonc
Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ, Durk and DeJ
Uuuuuuu, Uuuuuuu
