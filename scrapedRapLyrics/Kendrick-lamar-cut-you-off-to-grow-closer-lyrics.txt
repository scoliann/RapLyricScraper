Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo, you T'd, you turned down,
you thirsty,
you boo-boo!
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the
key to my blessings,
and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'mma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'mma cut you off
Cause everytime you come around, you be hollering that
Whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah,
he say, she say
Oh my God, shut the fuck up...
ho
Everytime you come around, you be hollering that
Whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah, he say, she say
Uhh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constantly stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger,
pussy nigga,
I'mma cut you off
I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught,
family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays,
left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
Keep it running, Ali
So tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!" Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd, you turnt down, you thirsty
*repeated in different ways*
Keep all that
What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See its known today that the human race is nothing
No moral, no standards
What were about to do is raise the level of expectations
No you dont have to have a lot of money
You dont have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say its as big as a crew, some say its as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if its as big as a religion
