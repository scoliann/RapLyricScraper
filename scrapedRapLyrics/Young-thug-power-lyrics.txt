We got london on the track
First you get that money then you get that power
If he turn his nose up, boy he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers
Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser
Bitch, I make it rain shower, ya dig that?
Ain't no one know a thing about ya, if you zip that
Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back
Beat that bitty, never crack, dig that, sheesh
Before I go without a sack, I swag pack
I spoiled my bitch and now she actin' like a brat
I make Ellis, I know Jimmy, he got racks
Bitch I'm bleedin' like a tat
Roll it, roll it, for me on ya back
Just for show my diamonds yellow like a taxi
I'm a cat, I'ma chase all them pussy rats
Pussy nigga better not look back
Or else I'm killin' 'em, hell yeah, that's a fact sheesh
There's blood all on my Timberlands
She make a nigga say "whaat?!"
I swear to God she feelin' 'em
She sucked like eight dicks, I call her Octagon
First you get that money then you get that power
If he turn his nose up, boy he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers
Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser
Bitch, I make it rain shower, ya dig that?
Ain't no one know a thing about ya, if you zip that
Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back
Beat that bitty, never crack, dig that, sheesh
Bitch, I dig it, I eat ice cream with my chickens
Bitch, I'm rich just like a Simmons, not Lil Diggy
If I got legs, bitch you know I'm gonna get it
She got good head, so she welcome to my Bentley
Big Bentley in that big Bentley, Bentley
Ridin' 'round with that semi, cuz I know these niggas envy
Is you mad 'bout Instagram or how I kick my pimpin'?
You keep that Ace of Spades, I'm sippin'
I'm a rocket, rocket, I can't stop it, stop it
I'm a GTV, boy, bitch I'm poppin, poppin'
I need coke, need coke like, "Where the fuck is papi?"
If you tryna run off, you know we pop ya noggin'
First you get that money then you get that power
If he turn his nose up, boy he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers
Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser
Bitch, I make it rain shower, ya dig that?
Ain't no one know a thing about ya, if you zip that
Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back
Beat that bitty, never crack, dig that, sheesh
