This is a Missy Elliott one-time exclusive, come on
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
If you got a [elephant trumpet], let me search you
And find out how hard I gotta work you
I'd like to get to know ya so I could show ya
Give me all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank, then call me ova
Call before you come, I need to shave my chocha
Go downtown and eat it like a vulture
See my hips and my tips, don't ya
See my ass and my lips, don't ya
Lost a few pounds and my waist for ya
This the kinda beat that go ra-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
I need a glass of water
Boy oh boy

If you a fly gal get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy, lift it up, let's make a toast-a
Let's get drunk, that's gonna bring us closer
Don't I look like a Halle Berry poster
See the Belvedere playing tricks on you
Girlfriend wanna be like me, never
You won't find a bitch that's even better
I make you hot as Las Vegas weather
Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards played backwards
I'm not a prostitute, but I could give you what you want
your mouth full of floss
Love the way my ass go bum-bum-bum-bum
Keep your eyes on my bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
You think you can handle this badonkadonk-donk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights on so you see what I could do
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup

Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, White, Puerto Rican,
Chinese boys
Girls, girls, get that cash
If it's 9 to 5 or shaking your ass
Ain't no shame, ladies do your thing
Just make sure you ahead of the game
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte a slave again, no sir
Picture black's saying, Oh yes'a massa (No!)
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute Man and Big Red could out last ya
When I come out, you won't even matter
As the drummer boy go ba-rom-pop-pom-pom
Give you some-some-some of this Cinnabun
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup

To my ladies, you sure know how to work that
