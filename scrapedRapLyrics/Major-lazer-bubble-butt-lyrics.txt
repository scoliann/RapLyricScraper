Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Drop it low put it in the dirt
Sex drive put it in reverse
Killed her ass put it in a hearse
Then I drove off and put it in the dirt
Drop it low put in the dirt
Take your top off turn into a vert
Bubble butt, busted in her throat
Smoking bubble kush wearing a bubble coat
Wind, go down, turn and flick it
A girl like me know how fi handle di wicket
One bat, two balls, swing it like cricket
Pull me locks, slap my ass, make me show you how me wicked
Baby baby mek me tell you 'bout the body yah
Make you vibrate like a Nokia
When me whine and bruk off that buddy yah
Uh huh, even kartel a happy yah
I had a cute thing, buenas noches
By the end of the night my knees are now on your chest
Fuck me bad, let me in, a cardic arrest
Let me wind upon your cock
Tick-tock-tick, riding the clock
Beat it, beat it, beat it bad, let me show you what I've got
I ain't Snoop Dogg, but I'mma drop it like it's hot
OK, open up your Bubba Gump
let me see your bumper
The booty so smooth, can't believe is not butter
I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer
I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burpin'
I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface
I load in my clip in and told her, 'Don't get nervous'
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy, bang, Bang, bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker
Ball like a dribble
Put you on a pickle,
Why you're tripping? I'm a crazy individual
Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too
Damn, bitch, talk much, I don't want interviews
I'm trying to get into you (into you)
Then make you my enemy
Me don't like flat screen, ass I need a 3D
