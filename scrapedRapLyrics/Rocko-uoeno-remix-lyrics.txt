U.O.E.N.O it
Po high class niggas
This shit sound crazy
Fly shit only
You know what Im sayin?
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it
Ay that monster truck, sit tall as fuck, its so big cant even tow it
Don't like snakes keep my grass cut, so low can't even mow it
Sip Dom Peri', little high glow, no no we dont do Moet
If it ain't P.J., no Rose from me hostess dont even pour it
Specks on Tom Ford, button-down Michael Kors
Always on like the refrigerator, Im plugged in, ho, you know it
A.P. and that Piguet, wear the Breitling when Im bored
Got a Masterpiece and a 41-millimeter, and you aint even know it
Keep the .45 in my pocket: aint gon' show it 'til I have to pop it
Then you gone know it, damn who shot you, they dont even know it
Hawks game fuckin' floor it, TV seat front row it
Rocko Da Don CEO it, aint gotta rap and you know it
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
We've got a lot of Marijuana
If you see me you got a problem
Run up on me like you want it
Guaranteed we're gonna solve it
They'll be thinkin' someone shot him
Hit him with a bottle
I'mma let a nigga have it
Started from the bottom
Now my diamonds looking autumn
presidential rollie
And I'll show you lil' niggas you can get it if you want it
U-O-E-N-O...
That good weed you don't even blow
See I drank so much Bombay in here tonight, can't even drive
See me all up on the curb, you think I'm drunk the way I'm swerving
See you ask how much it cost, you niggas got a lot of nerve
So much money
car service -
Phantom Rolls Royce curtains
Roll one more and that's curtains
Young Khalifa, that's curtains
In Taylor Gang we worship
Im turned up every day, you dont even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you dont even know it
We turn up in the club, you dont even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin', you dont even know it
We came up from nothin', you dont even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you dont even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don't even know it
