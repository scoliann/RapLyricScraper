It's gon' be okay, okay, oh it's gon' be okay
Well, my nigga we don't play but you gone be okay
I want no relations, I just want your facial
I want no relations, I just want your facial
(Pour some alcohol and drank it baby, go and taste it)
(Pour some alcohol and drank it baby, go and taste it)
I want no relations, I just want your facial
Girl you know you like a pistol, you a throw away
We gone drank girl we gone drink like its Cinco De Mayo
I won't ever tell you anything your heart desires
It's gone be okay okay girl it's gone be okay
I don't want no confrontation it's too complicated
Pour my lean for me baby you a hottie thottie
I'ma fuck you in Atlanta like we on an island
I can't lose my concentration girl I can't go on no dates
If we have a conversation gotta fuck today
I ain't disrespectful never, I ain't disrespectful
Got a black girl and a white one call em salt and pepper
I copped one of em a Beamer and one a Kompressor (skrr)
I told her I would call her back and I forgot to text her

Yea yea...Future Hendrix
I know your true feelings ain't..
They couldn't be here, you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else
But I ain't worried 'bout no fucking I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to ya
My love don't mean that much to ya
Fucking these hoes mean too damn much to you
I just hope up when you fuck a nigga when you finished
He can say that he love ya
Now do you feel better bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words ima ball without you
I came home last night to a mnage
Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you're fucking another nigga hope you're thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga are you thinking about me
Cause I'm thinking about you
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
I want you to fuck him in a paradise
Cause I wanna be in your head tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it, don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You going out the country, you posting up on IG
I'm layed up with my side piece
The one that text while you was right there laying up beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that your pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me your moving on, you don't love me no more
Monster
But I ain't worried 'bout no fucking I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to ya
My love don't mean that much to ya
Fucking these hoes mean too damn much to you
I just hope up when you fuck a nigga when you finished
He can say that he love ya
Now do you feel better bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words ima ball without you
I came home last night to a mnage
Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you're fucking another nigga hope you're thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga are you thinking about me
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
