Art of seduction
Hoes jump like Vince Carter
backstage like they a part of production
We talked about her dreams you gotta start off with somethin'
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustlin'
Found it funny cuz now they daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament,
I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin' on
Funny cause I only know a couple of your songs
But I love when they come on
Word?
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted,
?look in the blocks with mindplay?
This is superstar dick
Girl, how could you not taste it?
That's a little egotistic,
my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all RG
Cause he know bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know, hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me, you keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though
Nah nigga, the game is to get, a bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass into a craft, by now you'd be famous and rich
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch, while you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick
She thinking she got a first round pick, she thinking 'bout all the things she can get, she thinking you got a Range for a whip, and a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word,
wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs.. Aye
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot you not wasted,
?look in the blocks with mindplay?
This is superstar dick
Girl, how could you not taste it?
