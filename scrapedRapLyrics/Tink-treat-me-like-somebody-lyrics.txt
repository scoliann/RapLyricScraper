Somebody real is hard to find
Somebody worth all your time
Somebody who can tell you the truth
Someone who loves you for you
Someone who knows all of your flaws, and
Doesn't impose, try to control them
Let's you be free, doesn't deceive
They give you a chance to believe, believe in something
Is that too much?
Cause I've been on the search and I'm losing my hope
Is that too much? Is that too much?
Tryna find love in a world so cold
Oh, is that too much?
I just want an answer, I can't be the only one
Is that too much?
You ain't gotta be perfect
Just give me a purpose to love
I just want somebodybody
To treat me like somebodybody
Won't be like everybodybody
All you gotta do is love me for me, babe
I just want somebodybody
To treat me like somebodybody
Won't be like everybodybody
All you gotta do is love me for me, babe
Now don't be mislead by the things that I've said
In the past I was young, I was looking for a thrill
That didn't last long, I was in it for the wrong
Wrong reason, wrong season, wrong person (yeah)
Cause he just wanted one thing and I just wanted something
To smile at and live for and hug on (ohh)
I'd
rather have quality than quantity
Ohh, I just want someone that'll keep it real with me
Is that too much?
Cause I've been on the search and I'm losing my hope
Is that too much? Is that too much?
Tryna find love in a world so cold
Oh, is that too much?
I just want an answer, I can't be the only one
Is that too much?
You ain't gotta be perfect
Just give me a purpose to love
I just want somebodybody
To treat me like somebodybody
Won't be like everybodybody
All you gotta do is love me for me, babe
I just want somebodybody
To treat me like somebodybody
Won't be like everybodybody
All you gotta do is love me for me, babe
Oooouuuuuuuuah
Maybe I'm asking for too much
Yeah, yeah, yeahyeah, yeah
