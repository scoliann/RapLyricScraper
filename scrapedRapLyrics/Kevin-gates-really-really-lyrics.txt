Diamonds really diamonds
shining bright
cause I'm really grindin'
They ask me if I'm real, I say "is you serious?"
My daughter gon' love this bitch here
All my diamonds shine cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
Got money on my mind, I say "really really"
I look like I been ballin' cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
All the above we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
Grey Monte Carlo
cocaine 911
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhen Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me
All my diamonds shine cause they really diamonds
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
(Swim)
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
When yo bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man that's irregular
Take her phone disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats they glisten in all of my necklaces
All my diamonds shine cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
