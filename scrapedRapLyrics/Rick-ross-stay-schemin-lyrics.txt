I ride for my niggas, dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas, dawg, I ride for my niggas, dawg
(Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg)
Damn, life's so short
Fuck, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, Im on the run for the money
Im in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin, even got me paranoid
Im gettin money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got Gs out in California
(Young Frankie Geechi Liberace)
It bothers me when the gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesnt come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like yall
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Dont be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from DC that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga I hate it had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it", Im tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix
and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet,
told 'em butterfly it, shell love it
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line, we cant wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker getting mine off rap
with my niggas
[Verse 3: French Montana]
From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dog
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog
Dwight Howard on the post, dog
My niggas got the powder through the post, dog
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the Feds
10 grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn
Gave my nigga Max 7-5
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30
Fuck it,
got me thinking like I'm 7-5
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30
