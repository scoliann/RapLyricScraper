Turn me up!
Step up in this bitch like
(turn me up!)
I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah I'm the one your bitch like
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin' on my dick like
She wanna see if it'll fit right
That's just the wave
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own...
Sun don't shine in the shade
(turn me up!)
Bird can't fly in a cage
(turn me up!)
Even when somebody go away
(turn me up!)
The feelings don't really go away
That's just the wave (yeah)
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own you
No lie
No lie
No lie
You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning
No lie
[Outro: Chris Brown & Kid Cudi]
No lie
Ooh baby, ooh baby
You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning
No lie
