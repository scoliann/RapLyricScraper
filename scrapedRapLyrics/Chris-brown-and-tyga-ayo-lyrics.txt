I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you
Ah, ay babe, this my new shit
I'm the black Richie Rich with the roof missing
If it don't make dollars, don't make sense
Z, wake up like I gotta get it
And I got an engine full of trunk space
I get money three ways, fucking bitches three ways
7 different foreigns plus she no habl
But I make that bitch walk for some cheesecake
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Looking in the mirror like I wish I can be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hobby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'mma eat it, I'mma eat it
I don't lie, hold my dick, too conceited
Uh, told her she's my wife for the weekend
But don't be acting like I need you cause we poppin' like
Ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you
I'm in a Rolls, you don't roll right
My chain shine brighter than a strobe light
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
If I motorboat, she gon' motorbike
A nigga ain't worried about nothin'
Rehabilitation just had me worried'about fucking
Money, decision-making, only worried about stunting
She worried about me, her nigga worried about cuffing
I wanna see her body, body
And she said get inside of me
I wanna feel you baby, yeah
Just bring the animal right out of me
We loving, she love it
Especially when I go down on her
Now we fucking, she thugging
Getting loud, cause we poppin' like
Ayo

Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck em both like ayo

We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you
Huh, look, alright, now I can spot your bitch from a mile away
Valentine in that pussy, it's a holiday
Uh, you losing money, I win mills, Dr. J
She gon' to follow my lead, Simon Says
Paper, paper, I'm riding 'scrapers in California
Car smelling like ammonia, we got that stank on us
Never been an Outkast that stank on ya
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia
We in the hood, tatted like a Mexican
Car too fast, give a fuck about pedestrians
And my section less niggas, more lesbians
Got your bitch, I'm that nigga
Yeah we poppin' like
Ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck em both like ayo

We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you

Drop top, no roof, ah
