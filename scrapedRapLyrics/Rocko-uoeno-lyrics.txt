That nigga sold you that re-rock, you ain't even know it
I'd die over these Reeboks, you ain't even know it
Put Molly all in her champagne, she aint even know it
I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it
Got a hundred acres I live on, you ain't even know it
Got a hundred rounds in this AR, you ain't even know it
Got a bag of bitches I play with, on cloud 9 in my spaceship
Zoned out but he stay fresh from Zone 1 through Zone 6
Bricks all in my blood, birds all in my dreams
Boats all in my yard,

Im bout to get you fuck niggas wacked, you ain't even know it
Your main nigga bout to turn his back, you ain't even know it
