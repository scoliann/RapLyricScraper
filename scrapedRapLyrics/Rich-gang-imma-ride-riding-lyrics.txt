Woo! Know what I'm sayin'?
(Lil' whoadie 'bout that action)
Get money, fuck hoes
(Lil' whoadie 'bout that action)
Action, cash
(Lil' whoadie 'bout that action)
(Lil' whoadie 'bout that action)
Nigga playin' with my whoadie, I'ma ride
She say that that pussy wet so I'ma slide
She pull up and fuck the crew like she connivin'
Hey, I'ma cum all over her body
Hopped out the passenger side with my strap
We shinin' every summer, spend numbers
Lil' whoadie 'bout that action, we pull up, it's 'bout that
When I came 'round, I put it down, on front line, I did mine
Hustle life, we built this, had a block bumpin' like a second line
Cut niggas, them crunch niggas
Play around, you get cut, nigga
get pulled down, I won't cut, nigga
No lames, born rich and dangerous, high life and famous
Big MACs and them straps, nigga
Play around and get slashed, nigga
Woo! Know what I'm sayin'?

'73 Chevelle, put that shit together
Married to the money, yeah we live together
Love my F&N but still keep that Beretta
Made it to the top and I ain't use a ladder
Pass that shit around, then I go collect
Made it out the hood, now I'm on TV

Smokin' on the headband, nigga, I'm a stoner
Went from hangin' on the corner to hangin' with owners
I just did a feature, went and copped a Rollie
Woo! Know what I'm sayin'?

Yapper
that's my blood, that's my slime fool.
NASCAR speed on 'em
I got bitches in the spot callin' me big homie
I'm bouncin' like a trampoline, homie
So in love with this cash, all my shows have the cream, homie
I'm bangin' red like strawberries
I told your bitch ain't goin' steady
My weed is loud and you smokin' libraries
I got a thing for that fetish
All my diamonds green like lettuce
Woo! Know what I'm sayin'?
