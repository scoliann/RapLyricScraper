Yo bro, I think I had too much Hennessy man
This Hennessy getting to me
I ain't gonna lie, Im a little smizz
I'm a little drizz
But we in the club man, OOOUUU
Yea they hate but they broke though
And when it's time to pop they a no-show
Yea I'm pretty but I'm loco
The loud got me moving slow-mo
Ayo Tweetie, where the hoes bro?
Ayo Keys, where the hoes tho?
That other nigga, he a bozo
It's M.A, you don't know hoe?
We got liquor by the boatload (that Henny)
Disrespect the Lyfe that's a no-no
All my niggas dressed in that rojo (Redlyfe)
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code
Baby gave me head, that's a low blow
Damn she make me weak when she deepthroat
My brother told me fuck em', get that money sis
You just keep on grinding on ya hungry shit
Ignore the hating, ignore the faking, ignore the funny shit
Cause if a nigga violate, we got a hunnit clips
And we go zero to a hundred quick
We just them niggas you ain't fucking with
Pockets on a chubby chick
And still go bag a thottie in some bummy shit
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me?
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me?
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame?
If that's your chick, then why she texting me?
Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?
Every time I'm out, why she stressing me?
You call her Stephanie? I call her Headphanie
I don't open doors for a hoe
I just want the neck, nothin' more
may get applause
call
Dyke bitches talking out they jaw
Next minute calling for the law
This nine will have them calling for the lord
They ain't getting shmoney so they bored
I'm killing them, sorry for your loss
I just caught a body, Randy Moss
Now this year I'm really going off
OOOUUU
OOOUUU
OOOUUU
OOOUUU
OOOUUU
OOOUUU
These haters on my body shake em' off
I could never lose what you thought? What they thought?
I could never lose what you thought?
This henny got me, it got me sauced
This henny got me oh, it got me sauced
I could never lose what you thought?
M.A got it on lock man of course
OOOUUU
OOOUUU
