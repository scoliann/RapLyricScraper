[Verse 1]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statements just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga
That's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna,
you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh, well
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh, well
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
[Outro: Birdman]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines,
big time
Sunshine,
tote nines,
bust mines
Flatline, hard grind,
high life
Stay fly it's jet time,
stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga, stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga, stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga, stunt nigga
