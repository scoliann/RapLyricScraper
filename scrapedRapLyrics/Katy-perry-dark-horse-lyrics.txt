Yeah ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry
Juicy J
Uh huh, let's rage!
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
Cause I-I-I
I'm capable of anything
Of anything
And everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy
Your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for?
Ready for?
A perfect storm?
Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no going back
Hey! [etc.]
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or a no?
No maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for?
Ready for?
A perfect storm?
Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no going back
She's a beast, I call her Karma
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for?
Ready for?
A perfect storm?
Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no going back
