Im living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, Im tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We aint got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, Ill see you in the morning
Huh? Ill see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, Im tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that, the worlds ours
And they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)
[Verse 2]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
Im an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, hes so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, Im fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking
No one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, Im tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the worlds ours
And they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obamas nation
Well thats a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it Im killing this shit
I know damn well yall feeling this shit
I dont need your pussy, bitch, Im on my own dick
I aint gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How Ye doing? Im surviving
I was drinking earlier, now Im driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting
[Outro]
Now this will be a beautiful death
(Im jumping out the window, Im letting everything go)
You got the power to let power go?
(21st-Century schizoid man)
