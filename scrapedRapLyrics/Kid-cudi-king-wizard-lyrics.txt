Its just me and my niggas
And my family
And people that care about me and my fans
Fuck all these other niggas
I cant decide
What if lifes a lie?
I push the lames aside
Theyll learn
I can never front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, theyll burn
I cant decide
What if lifes a lie?
I push the lames aside
Theyll learn
I can never front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
Theyll never take me alive
King Wizard!
You love that little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggas know the uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, don't know a damn thing about him
What is hip hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know
Go, all day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight
Yup now fuck you I ain't left
I'm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ain't missed one step (yet, yup)
I cant decide
What if lifes a lie?
I push the lames aside
Theyll learn
I can never front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, theyll burn
I cant decide
What if lifes a lie?
I push the lames aside
Theyll learn
I can never front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
Theyll never take me alive
King Wizard!
My head hurt, gotta give me something that'll make me feel good
I remember couldn't tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would
Niggas ain't working, like me I had to put my bid in
All this rose gold I'm dipped in
Juste un clou, while I coast through clouds
That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally gonna be my world
Here all the girls can be my girls
Just sit back count stacks girl
Hold a nigga down all the time girl
I cant decide
What if lifes a lie?
I push the lames aside
Theyll learn
I can never front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, theyll burn
I cant decide
What if lifes a lie?
I push the lames aside
Theyll learn
I can never front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
Theyll never take me alive
King Wizard!
