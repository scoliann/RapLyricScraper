Now you're thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognize
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition is not enough
I don't care about nobody else
Cause I've been on these streets way too long, too long, too long
Baby I've been on this too long
Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
And I'mma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note
Oh but until then
I got you
Baby I got you
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you
So baby love me
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me
Because they'll all love me
I'll be different
I think I'll be different
I hope I'm not different
And I hope you'll still listen
But until then
Baby I got you
I got you
Girl I still got you
I got you
