Gotta get real again, gotta get real again
No, you got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas, I want you
I want you, to turn up on me, every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you, hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do, even look like Lauren London too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I aint trippin' off of any of your niggas
Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I aint give a shit about shit, nigga
(Girl I see you)
No, you got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas, I want you
I want you, to turn up on me, every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you, hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do, even look like Lauren London too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I aint trippin' off of any of your niggas
Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I aint give a shit about shit, nigga

[Interlude]
Girl you must be doin' magic
Girl you must be doin' magic
Turn fuckin' you to a habit
I could name a lot of things any other man
Wont do for you, I do for you
When I hit you at your condo real late
Check the scene and see if you straight
Then cut like kids cake
I got that feelin' for you, that feelin' that you crave
Each time I do it for you, I make that bad pussy behave
Now pop it, bottles, the top is so open
The budget I'm Party so fuck it
The concierge told me my new baby looking like LeToya Luckett
Let my money get older and older and older and older like Regis
And she will not fuck with no broke niggas, no, nigga, only the richest
No, you got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas, I want you
I want you, to turn up on me, every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you, hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do, even look like Lauren London too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I aint trippin' off of any of your niggas
Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I aint give a shit about shit, nigga
(Girl I see you)
Yeah shout the girls from the east who know what's good with me
Shout the ones from the west know what's good with PND
Stories of you and your girls is all I hear
Who do you fuck in the city when I'm not there?
(I owe you time) let's plan somethin' out when I come back from Europe
Swear I'm withholdin' my urges 'til you get this one-on-one shit like your name Katie Couric
I gotta get you those snow tires for your Mercedes, I'm glad you reminded me baby
All of these things slip my mind it's been crazy
Bite on your shoulder I know that's your favorite
Touching yourself to that video we made a month ago
You a freak and your cover's blown
How you talked me into sendin' that to you, I'll never know
Fuck it girl, I'm 'bout whatever though
Yeah I guess a nigga just believe in you
And that's proof for you
Could name a lot of things any other man won't do for you
I'll do it for you, that's real
I want you, to turn up on me, every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you, hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do, even look like Lauren London too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I aint trippin' off of any of your niggas
Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I aint give a shit about shit, nigga
