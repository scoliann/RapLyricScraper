Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, took a lil' sip
T-T-Took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the old testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-T-Took a little, took a little, took a little sip
[Bridge x2: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'mma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the boyz the man now like Wany
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-T-Took a little, took a little, took a little sip
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Don't shit last, and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitchhh, bitchhh
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitchhh
[Outro Skit: Lil Cole]
