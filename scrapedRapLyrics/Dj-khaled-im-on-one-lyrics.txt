[Intro: DJ Khaled]
I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm 'on one)
I get 'em up! (I said Im on one)
DJ Khaled!
Uhh, Im getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say anything I dont mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
Cause all that hype dont feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and Ill be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
Im just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!
[Hook: Drake]
All I care about is money an' the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I dont really give a fuck, and my excuse is that Im young
And Im only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
Im on one, yeah, fuck it Im on one
Yeah, I said "Im on one", fuck it Im on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and Imma get that shit
Cause Im on one, I said "fuck it, Im on one"
Im burning purple flowers,
its burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt,
move the kids to the hills
(Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya "everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
And its double M G until I get the chair

Money to be got, and Imma get that shit
Cause Im on one, I said "fuck it, Im on one"
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
Im a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
Im focused might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, Im about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches Mazeltov
Its a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, dont ask me how I got it
Im killin these hoes I swear Im tryna stop the violence
(Young mula baby, YMCMB)
