More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
Girl, we should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
Life is great when youre naked, you press the gas and I break it
I drink liquor dont chase it and I get women dont chase em
Ill put her face in the pillow and watch her bite on the blanket
See you tempted to taste it, get every drop and dont waste it
Im fucking with you, Im fucking with you
The type of dick to make that white girl say I love that nigga
Ill hit your Instagram and click like on like every picture
You get it from your momma, well then bring ya momma with ya
And lots of liquor, tell her "fuck me like you hate me"
"You love me?" I said maybe
She said "boy don't keep me waiting"
And I say "go down, don't be lazy"
Yeah, now that's my baby, that's my baby
She love me for my drive, I love her cause she drive me crazy
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
Girl, we should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
[Verse 2: Drake]
OVO I ride, OMO I ride
Reps Up, them my niggas from the Scarborough side
Dont fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly
I dont have to lie
Lot of people say it in a song just to say it, man, Im not that type of guy
Hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city, send you home with stories you can never tell
Im tryna break you out of your shell (And what?)
You just turned 21 like Adele, thats good with me
I put my business on hold, let me turn off the phone
Lets explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure,
I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that youd rather smoke
Well, let me call up OBs room and tell em roll up a cone
I know he probably got that extra special
I never second guess it
How's Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?
Man, she like "fuck the small talk"
Im not here to discuss extra credits or my professors
No time for funny stories
Its funny how she shows up late, but always comes before me
We both young and misguided, but thats another story, yeah
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
Girl, we should just get
(Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk)
