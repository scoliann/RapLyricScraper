(Now it's time for our wrap up
Gift of Gab
Artificial amateurs, aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats, got they canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily
doin' dough
Don Dada
on the down low
Eating other editors with each and every energetic epileptic episode
elevated etiquette
Furious
fat
fabulous, fantastic
Gift got great, global goods gone glorious
Gettin' godly in this game with the goriest
hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize
I intimidate
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state
Juiced on my jams like Jheri curls
jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Karate kick type Brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves,
masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice,
naturally
make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's
Quannum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got
Really raw raps,
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique, untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make em vanish
weeded up on my workshift
Xerox my X-radiation holes extra large
X-height letters and xylophone tones
Yellow-back,
yak mouth, young ones
Yesterday's lawn yardsale, I yawn
Zig-Zag zombies, zooming to the zenith
overzealous rhyme
ZEA-LOTS!
(Good... can you say it faster?)
