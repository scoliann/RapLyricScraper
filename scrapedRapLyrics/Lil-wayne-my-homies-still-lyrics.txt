[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck ya'll with a sick dick,
Semi automatic no click click
We don't feel you like an elephant, gettin' fucked with a tick dick
Little nigga with a thick bitch,
and before I fuck this bitch
I gotta put that patch over my third eye, Slick Rick
Trukfit, T-Shirt,
talk second, skeet first
Boy yo girl a jump off,
I hope she land feet first
She give me brain, research, and I prefer, reefer
But if you want some coke, that's cool, cause my homies still
Yeah my homies still
My homies still
Yeah my homies still
Dont make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, yeah
Dont make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, yeah
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My girls and cars both skirt off
I like a pussy so wet that I can surf off
In a hot spot cause a nigga never chillin'
I do it for my niggas, I just do it to these bitches
Boy, I overgrind, overshine
Ain't another nigga over Sean
I'm getting paid, it's Oprah time
Im rollin' pine, Im so divine
Im West side, West side
Dark glasses on like I'm goin' blind
Looking like Eazy E,
its just me and Lil Weezy-we
Get off my dick!
Look, Im east side them haters 90 going west
My niggas pumping so much bass, muthafuckas going deaf
Weezy F, I'm east side them haters 90 going west
My niggas pumping so much bass (Pump that bass)
Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi,
I dont love them hoes
Got so much coke, you gon' need another nose
Man I just play my hand, but I am not the dealer
You see I got them tear drops, I cry yo ass a river
I got that Trukfit t-shirt,
listenin' to Rebirth
I skate until my feet hurt,
hot boy, free Turk
Pussy for dessert
Put your ass beneath Earth
And I dont sell drugs, but if you need work
My homies still
Whoa, okay, boi this heres what I do do
Got your sister dancing, not the kind that's in a tutu
Got me in control, no strings attached, that's that voodoo
She said cant nobody do it better, I tell her, true true yep bitch true true
My my bro bro say these bitches ain't shit
I got the girl you came with and the girl she came wit
She leaking and drippin,
whoa there I might just come slip in
And your misses gonna go missin
If she addicted to what my dick did
Boy I get it
(Lil Bitch!)
My homies still (Finally Famous in this)
Yeah my homies still
