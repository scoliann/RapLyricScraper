[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Alright, um, Wolf Haley, Odd Future, Wolf Gang nigga
You know what, you know fuck it
I don't even wanna go
I'm gonna let my little brother Earl Sweatshirt get on you niggas
Hey Earl, hit em
[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
So I'm guessin' there's questions that need addressing, huh?
Like how we fresh in our adolescence and wrecking 'em
Hand'em tracks, he destined to make a mess of 'em
Snapping necks and records in matter of seconds check 'em son
Lost an erection and found it in an aggressive nun
Fucking chin-checkin' punks 'til he's outta breath and done
No FX, in these doper than sess sessions son
Chilling for a while on a pile of the rest of 'em
Let the crowd choose who can fucking last longest
It's the rap monger,
rap monster Earl Sweat attack, conquer
Lose least,
niggas lost like the last blanca chica
That we picked up at the last concert
Please, get out ya seat, get out ya seat,
verses written with scalpels
He's the junior king standing out shouting on the balcony
How come he's not in counseling?
Fucka's loud while he's sound asleep
Heard he was dope as Sour D,
nigga, was Courage cowardly?
Stay Gold, alchemy,
nigga we rap's Alpha Team
Mr. Teen
and Mr. T
with a mouth full of powder
And a nose full of chowder,
he's choppin' up all the doubters see
Now watch him count the bodies
like bitches be counting calories
[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
Fuck with the Wolves, we starting to bark viciously
Catch us in a pile of bodies where dead bitches be
Box Logo hoodies and goodies from buddies that understand
That Bastard was buzzing like Woody so we get it for free
Had to duct tape the mother goose; the mask was off
I stumbled down a hill then I had Jill jack me off
Harder than my dick when Taylor Swift is in my basement
Cause I've been doing this since Pooh fucked Christopher Robinson
Wolf Gang knitted on my cotton like some smelly
Dirty rotten nigger picked it from a cotton gin
Do not give a fuck I've got the swagger of a virgin's dick
But if I did it would be bigger than Earl's upper lip
Sip sizzurp,
Supreme on my shizzirt
I munch a bunch of tacos
with Waverly's favorite wizard
The favorite nigger turned
into Freddy Kruger
And this that raw shit, dead bodies chopped up in the sewer
From the palms of Jeffrey Dahmer,
baby mamas said the kicks
Beat like the brown lip balm that was made for Rihanna
All you fucking bloggin' faggots yappin' up that extra shit
I'll shove Bastard down your throat, regurgitate my excrement
Them 2DopeBoyz is fairies they're Peter like boysenberries
Meka scary,
turn his white ass to a Jim Carrey twin
A fuckin' sausage fest will them shaky niggas get married then
2DopeBoyz don't want beef, they're just overweight vegetarians
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Fucking faggots
Wolf Gang, Kill 'Em All
Don't give a fuck, litter life
Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator
I mean, Wolf Haley
Fucking radical
[Outro: Jasper Dolphin]
Haha Niggas murdered this shit, know what Im saying
Odd Future Wolf Gang
know what Im saying
Fuck them dope faggots my niggas
We dont give a fuck nigga,
we a wolf pack my nigga
we keep you up barking and shit nigga
Niggas, little niggas doing it big, know what Im saying, y'all niggas 40 and shit still in the game
These young niggas come outta nowhere taking out all that shit, know what Im saying
Give me a iced out motherfucking Odd Future donut chain, like fuck everybody else nigga, Wolf Gang
