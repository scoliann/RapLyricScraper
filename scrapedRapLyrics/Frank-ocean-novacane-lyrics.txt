I think I started something, I got what I wanted
Did, didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping,
every single record autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, aww
Stripper booty and a rack like wow,
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella,
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley, at least you working
But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smoking anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste
Novacane, baby, baby, Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb
Sink full of dishes pacing in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shooting
I'm feeling like Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on moving
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feeling I never had, never had, never had
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you
I still can't feel my face, what am I smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of
Novacane, baby, baby, Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb
Novacane for the pain
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
I can't feel a thing
I can't feel her
Novacane for the pain
