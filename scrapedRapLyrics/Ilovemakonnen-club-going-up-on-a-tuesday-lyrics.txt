Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway
I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink
I'm doing my stance, you know my Molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
It ain't no way no how
I made it on my own, I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay, you know I gotta go
You moving too fast, don't want to take it slow
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
