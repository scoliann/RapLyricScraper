[Produced by Dr. Dre]
[Intro: Snoop Dogg and Kurupt]
La-da-da-da-dahh
It's the motherfucking D-O-double-G (Snoop Dogg!)
La-da-da-da-dahh
You know I'm mobbin' with the D-R-E
You know who's back up in this motherfucker?
What what what what
So blaze the weed up then
Blaze it up, blaze it up
Just blaze that shit up, nigga
Yeah, 'sup, Snoop?
[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Top Dogg, bite 'em all,
nigga, burn the shit up
D-P-G-C, my nigga, turn that shit up
C-P-T, L-B-C,
yeah, we hooking back up
And when they bang this in the club, baby, you got to get up
Thug niggas, drug dealers, yeah, they giving it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy, we living it up
Taking chances while we dancing in the party for sure
Slip my ho a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches looking at me strange, but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swanging my hair
Bitch, quit talking, Crip walk, stay down with the set
the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch, shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin' your stress
La-da-da-da-dahhh
It's the motherfucking D.R.E. (Dr. Dre, motherfucker)
La-da-da-da-dahhh
You know I'm mobbin' with the D-O-double-G
Straight off the fucking streets of C-P-T
King of the beats, you ride to 'em in your Fleet (Fleetwood)
Or Coupe DeVille rolling on dubs
How you feeling whoopty whoop, nigga what?
Dre and Snoop chronic'd out in the 'llac
With Doc in the back, sippin' on 'gnac
Clip in the strap, dipping through hoods (what hoods?)
Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood
South Central out to the westside;
it's California Love
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club
With my jeans on, and my team strong
Get my drink on, and my smoke on
Then go home with something to poke on
Loc, it's on for the two-triple-oh
Coming real, it's the next episode
[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Hold up, hey
For my niggas who be thinking we soft, we don't play
We gonna rock it 'til the wheels fall off
Hold up, hey
For my niggas who be acting too bold, take a seat
Hope you ready for the next episode
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Smoke weed every day
