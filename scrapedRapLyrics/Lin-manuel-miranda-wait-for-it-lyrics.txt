Theodosia writes me a letter every day
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine
Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya
My mother was a genius
My father commanded respect
When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect
Preacher, preacher
Preacher
Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
Respect, respect
Genius
Death doesnt discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if theres a reason Im still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
Im willing to wait for it
Im willing to wait for it
Wait for it

[ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
I am the one thing in life I can control
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
I am inimitable
I am an original
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Im not falling behind or running late
Im not standing still
I am lying in wait
Wait
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
Climb
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose
Lose
Hamiltons pace is relentless
He wastes no time
[ENSEMBLE]
Time
Time
Time
What is it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesnt hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if theres a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit
[BURR]
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it...
Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
We rise
We fall
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
Then I'm willin' to
[BURR]
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
[WOMEN]
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
[MEN]
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
