Started out with nothing, I was hungry
Now I got a couple niggas' bitches on me
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie
All I wanna do is count commas
I had to make a couple bands for the come up
Got kicked out the house, I had no option
I was going through it with my mama
Ju-juggin and finnesin' had to play it raw
Smoking weed dodging feds cause my head hard
When I dropped out I said fuck all of y'all
Imagine pulling up to your school in the best car
I was born in 94 I got the tattoo
I just took his bitch that's what that cash do
If you went from broke to rich quick you would brag too
I'm sorry I finnessed you out your money but I had too
Started out with nothing, I was hungry
Now I got a couple niggas' bitches on me
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, you mad, or nah?
Fuck nigga don't want war
Them things go rah-rah-rah
These thots don't get no love
My pockets is on large
I'm swimming in the guap
I got gold all on my watch
My belt cost more than your check
I'm throwing all this money like Brett
I know I make ya girl so wet
I know this pussy nigga upset
I'm winning I'm winning you lose
That's your fault should have never snoozed
You broke, never make no moves
I be making movies, no Tom Cruise
Started out with nothing, I was hungry
Now I got a couple niggas' bitches on me
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie
