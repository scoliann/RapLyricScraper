Rrrr Ting
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy, get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy
Black Benz on the road, boy, already had a Rolls Royce
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad, boy
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing
I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
