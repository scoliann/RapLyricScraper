[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott & (Young Thug)]
Twelve more hours left for us in a day
I've been drinkin' all day, I've been floatin' all day
Bring your ass over here now
You know where, how I stay
I've been gone for some time now
I just want a lil' taste
Mix it, mix it, pour (lean, lean)
Drinkin', sippin', slow
Drink so cold now, froze, froze, froze
Come on over, get drunk
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Damn girl, I'll be up late
If you want you can meet me at the studio
Yeah, I've been drinkin' all night
Take a shot, all we got is Don Julio
I'm guessin' this is new to you
Thinkin' 'bout all the things that I would do to you
Them lips on fire and them hips don't lie
Girl I just wanna see what that booty do
Let's lose each other's mind
Let's make each other's night
We'll take advantage of time
While we're both intertwined
Girl I want you on the rocks, no chaser
Be sure to drink it all, won't waste ya
I know you stay sober
I'm sure a few drinks won't faze you
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Caress lil' mama for weed, and she did it for free
Yeah, that thing wet, baby, I need skis
Yeah I need to skeet
Run it back from the track
Then I'ma speed race in that
Lil' mama still got my back
Pull down your pants, I want crack
I'm growing weed, this ain't trees (Bitch)
My bitch brown like Hennessy (Bitch)
Big blood like Freddy in dreams (Bitch)
Dressed in a tie like the Dean (Bitch)
Drunk and in love with my baby
Baby do not go fast, go slow, wait
Tell me, tell me information I got rank (tell me)
Let's take a shot together and then lay up like planks
Never ever, do I wanna leave my little lady
Patrn down, back down, they got a plan 'fore that boy wake
Told God if I get a iced out watch I won't be late (I promise)
Every time I try to stick it in all the way
Baby girl be like "ay ay, ay ay"
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
