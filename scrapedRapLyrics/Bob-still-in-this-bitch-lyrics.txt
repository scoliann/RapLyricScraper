I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
automatic cookup
B Rich pull up in that rooster 'til we wake the fucking hood up
Got all these pounds of ganja, I work out, I'm doing kushups
pop that pussy throw a foot up
What's up Eastside
Yeah we can do this here all night, can't tell me nothing, can't tell me shit
All in my zone, all on my own
Open that pack, rollin' that strong
And we still up in this bitch, won't turn down, won't go home
I got big wheels on my ride,
spent about six mills on my ride
You catch me swervin' all on your side of town
bumpin' bitch don't kill my vibe
Don't blow my high
Your baby daddy disrespect me, black his eye, that's no lie
I'm on my square
blowing circles in the air, of that purple
I'm a boss and you a worker
You want trouble I got plenty, how you want it full or semi
I'm so rich so all that fuckboy shit you kickin' don't offend me
Boy it's been eleven years of this shit, look at me now still in this bitch
All these bad bitches
all this free liquor
Surrounded by so many women one of these hoes might be your wife
She lookin' for a nigga that's ballin' so tonight might be her night
lowkey I threw tuition at Onyx
Flip money fast like Sonic,
rich nigga I speak ebonics
Got a new car I paid cash,
got a new crib with a weed lab
Hundred deep in V.I.P.
I got your boo in my Bugatti,
she bout to swallow my babies
My system loud my weed loud
no hair clippers I'm faded
