I'll let you show me his moves
Let you do what he taught you
Let you reminisce how you used, to do
Girl Im open to anything that'll get you into that zone
And understand that were all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
Baby girl you know what's in store
And baby I will stay up all night
I've been goin' hard since last night
And I'mma go harder tonight
Wish you could see you through my eyes
Ooh I'm telling you this ain't the same
And I know he's still in your brain
I'm 'bout to burn that shit into flames
Once I'm in you
Baby
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
'Cuz baby when I'm finished with ya you won't wanna go
Outside
And I'mma work you like a pro, baby
And, you gon' take it like one
Yeah you gon' take it like one
And I'mma give it like you asked for it
Why, cuz you been talkin' 'bout it
I know you been talkin' 'bout it
Ooh baby when I'm done with you
You ain't saying nothing
Yeah you ain't saying nothing
Ooh baby when I'm done with you
You ain't saying nothing
Yeah you ain't saying nothing
You gon' make me show off
All the pain that you feel you can tell that we ain't making no love
But I'll pretend
Oh girl, I'll pretend
If you pretend then girl I'll pretend
Let's make it seem like we're all we need in the end
[Hook]
