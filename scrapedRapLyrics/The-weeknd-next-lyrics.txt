She popped that pussy on a Monday
She never falls in love
But she heard me in the club, she couldn't run
She wanna give me all her money
She used to spend it all alone cause her man went and did her wrong, so she
But baby I'm not tryin' to be the one
I got my baby waitin' home
She been too good to let that go
And I ain't tryna win your heart
And you can't pay to win my love
So keep dancin', baby, keep dancin', dancin'
Keep dancin', dancin', keep dancin'
(I want you)
I know, yes, I know
Yes, I know, yes, I know
Yes, I know
Baby (I want you)
I'm too far in this game to let go
So let go, so let go
Baby (I want you)
Baby, who you tryna fool
Girl, I might be twenty-one, but I got memories to prove
That I've seen your kind before
And I know exactly what you want
You just want me cause I'm next
You just want me cause I'm next, baby
Baby, who you callin' soft
Don't make me smoke up all your kush
Don't make me pop your cheap ass pills
I used to do this for the thrill
I know you got a lot to lose
But ain't nobody here but me
So baby what you got to prove
I see the way your body moves
On the pole, on the floor, you're alone
But there ain't nothing I can do
So keep dancin', baby, keep dancin', dancin'
Keep dancin', dancin', keep dancin'
