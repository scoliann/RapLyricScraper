Lickwood means "rewind" and gunshot means "forward"
You requested it, so we rewind
Yeah, way, way, way up
Turn it all up, yeah, look
I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin with the kid and pray for your nigga
[Verse 1]
I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin online, that aint part of my day
I got real shit poppin with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
I got two mortgages, thirty million in total
I got niggas thatll still try fuckin me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yeah
I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin with the kid and pray for your nigga
I got people talkin down, man, like I give a fuck
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin shit, just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they aint really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales bout how they gon run up on me
Well, run up when you see me then and we gon see
[Hook]
I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin with the kid and pray for your nigga
Nah, fuck all of you niggas, I aint finished
Yall dont wanna hear me say its a go
Yall dont wanna see Win Win, 50 or woe
I got real ones livin past Kennedy Road
I got real ones wit' me everywhere that I go

Every time I see em, somethin wrong with their memory
Tryna take it away from a nigga
So tired of savin all these niggas, mayne

Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin with the kid and pray for your nigga
