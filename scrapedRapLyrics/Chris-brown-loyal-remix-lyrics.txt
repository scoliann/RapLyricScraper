[Intro: Lil Wayne & Chris Brown]
Young Mula, baby
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes aint right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she aint have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, thats that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart when she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch a inch when she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes, she be mine by half time, Im the shit, oh
Nigga, thats that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes aint loyal
These hoes aint loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke niggas bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I dont fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the Bay with me
Rolling up that Bob Marley, Im a rasta
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes aint loyal
These hoes aint loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, lets get to it right away
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
Thats a no-no girl
Just got rich
Took a broke niggas bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I dont fuck with broke bitches
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes aint loyal
These hoes aint loyal
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me see
[Verse 4: Tyga]
Uh
rich young nigga
Name got bigger and my change got bigger, so my chains got bigger
Ferrari, Jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screaming out, "Money ain't a thing"
Ha, me and CB in the Bay with her
I sent her back home so you can lay with her
Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carrying
All these karats like I'm a fucking vegetarian
Shout-out Weezy F.,
keep a red bone wet
Rose Rolex, hoes on deck, she know I got a check
Do it too good when she ride that dick
Man I wouldn't trust that bitch, no
Come on, come on, girl, why you fronting?
Baby show me something
You done spent your bread on her
And its all for nothing
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes aint loyal
These hoes aint loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes aint loyal, they be playing games, yeah
These hoes aint loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Yeah, let me see
Yeah, let me see
Let me see
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal, let me see
