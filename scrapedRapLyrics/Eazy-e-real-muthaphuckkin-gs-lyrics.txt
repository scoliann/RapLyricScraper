Comp-ton, Comp-ton, Comp-ton
Ahh Real muthaphuckkin G's
[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Hey yo Doctor
And it's phat, watch the sniper,
time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See you's a wannabe 'loc,
and you'll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre, motherfuck Snoop, motherfuck Death Row
Yo, and here comes my left blow
Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid you found a pup and now you're dapper
But tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper
Talkin' bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a she-thang
So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to deez
Motherfuckin' real G's
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up
Boy you should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up
Boy you should have known by now
Everyday it's a new rapper, claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the, nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard, is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness, to your fuckin' work
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me, knowing that they pranksters
This is going out to you
studio gangstas
See I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talking about they come from projects
Knowing you ain't seen the parts of the streets G
Think you started trying to bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag, tried to sag, but you're flooding at the same time
So nigga please, check nuts before ya step to these
Motherfuckin real G's
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition original baby gangsta
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
Cause if you do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you off something
Claiming my city but, Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin G's
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up
Boy you should have known by now
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now nigga it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg, think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches, can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beating up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick, to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothing but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin G's
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up
Boy you should have known by now
Boy you should have known by now: Eazy Duz It
