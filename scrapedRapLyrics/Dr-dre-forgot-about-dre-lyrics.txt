[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same OG, but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese
No deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's, the Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said "Mothafuck the police!"
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all! If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me
And turn me back to the old me
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs, trying to walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
From here on out, it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies,
sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie! (Dada?)
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me, with your hands out, looking up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' bout guns
Like I ain't got none; what, you think I sold 'em all
Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What, cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
