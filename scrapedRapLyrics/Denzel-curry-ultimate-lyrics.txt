Ronny J, listen up
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate
Hey, young boy had to penetrate
Face, young boy done caught a case
Bang, now his mama living with the pain
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay
Let him get the senzu bean so he regenerate
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus
Dropping it in her esophagus
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it
Girl, I can make you a star
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch
Narcissist, part time an arsonist
Ripping through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
Feeling like Spartacus
I am the best, there's no politics, bitch, I'm ultimate
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
never knew my life
But yet the question is is he fake, is he real
What the message is,
I kill 'em, no Kony,
these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Flow like a foreigner,
Out of South Florida,
call the coroner
Killed in the corridor
Im an animorph
Bitch, Im a beast
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better love something than get a degree
This for Lord Infamous so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches looking thirsty,
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates
