Hi, I'm looking for Molly
I've been searching everywhere
[Hook: Siri]
And I can't seem to find
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
(Fucked around and fell in love with her)
Bands all in my dollars
I'm everywhere it's poppin'
Can't fall in love I got options
I'm high school that's college
King Gold Chains, that's Notre Dame
That green, yeah I got it
I show up in the party
Like where the fuck that molly
O-D we're O-G's
We don't fuck with no police
I'm too fly to be low key
Them 24 inch Kobes
All black that's Jodeci
She gimme pussy that's Josie
Broke niggas stop beggin' me
Cause that's the shit that I don't need
I'm swervin', I'm drivin'
Ain't got time to be tired
I'm super turnt, don't try me
Killin' yo mind off and fuckin' yo body
Bitch wanna flick, pose for my posse
Got too much shit to worry about gossip
I'm on a bad trip
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
My new car's imported
My bank account is enormous
Weed so loud it's distorted
Got champagne and we pourin' it
She poppin' it and she snortin' it
My iPhone recordin' it
, if I want it, I can afford it
Bitch I'm Young Khalifa, fillin' my lungs with reefer
Somewhere in the clouds, gotta press up to see us
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I made, then you won't even believe it
Me and T-Y gettin' gnarly when we pull up to the party
Brought a whole pound of Mary
Put it in my drink, put it in my drink
Put it in my drink, you already know
Put it in my drink, put it in my drink
Put it in my drink, you already know
