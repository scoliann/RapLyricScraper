We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isnt much
But its enough to make me wonder whats in store for us
Its lust, its torturous
You must be a sorceress, cause you just
Did the impossible: gained my trust
Dont play games, itll be dangerous if you fuck me over
Cause if I get burnt, I'mma show ya what its like to hurt
Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil; spell it backwards, Ill show ya
Nobody knows me, Im cold
Walk down this road all alone
Its no ones fault but my own
Its the path Ive chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Dont ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Blood suckin succubuses
What the fuck is up with this?
Ive tried in this department
But I aint had no luck with this; it sucks, but its
Exactly what I thought it would be, like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart
But some kinda emotional roller coaster
Something I wont go on
So you toy with my emotions, ho, its over
Its like an explosion every time I hold ya
I wasnt joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, youre a supernova, and I'm a

Im a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And Im aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And Im aiming right at you
Right at you, right at you
Ill do whatever it takes
When Im with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I aint with you, I have zero strength
Theres no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one
Then once we get them its never the same
You want them when they dont want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
Its not a contest and I aint on no conquest for no mate
I wasnt looking when I stumbled on to you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake
What the fuck does it take?
Lets cut to the chase
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I wont be making a mistake, cause I'm a

Im a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And Im aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And Im aiming right at you
Right at you, right at you
So after a year and six months, its no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and Im pleadin'
Im tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You wont even listen, so fuck it
Im tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Aint no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But its over now, its too late to save our love
Just promise me youll think of me every time
You look up in the sky and see a star, cause I'm a
Im a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And Im aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And Im so lost without you
Without you, without you
