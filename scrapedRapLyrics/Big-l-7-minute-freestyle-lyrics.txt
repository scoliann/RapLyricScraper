[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo, I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
Putting thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet,
known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow? Hell no!
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough
I'm known for yokin' Japs, and beating 'em with smokin' gats
Leaving token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit, step to the rear, son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
Cause in a street brawl
I strike men like lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight, friend? Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes,
I leave trails of dead mic's
Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided, crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand folks
Selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a TEC stuck down your throat
I'm telling you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a mothafucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hottie stare
I keep a shotty near
It's that nigga with notty hair
who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most,
I'm leaving niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed, and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school I had braids, I kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak, cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper,
punk brother vamper
Fuck around, you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a wild town,
you know my style, clown, so bow down
Word up,
'95 style... I got my man Jay-Z here
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Brothers can beg and borrow, still feel sorrow
When Jay Z like Zorro, get in that ass, better luck tomorrow
I'm too much, nigga, so never should you rush
You need slow down or get your ass tore down
Check it out, I'm too cocky, to stop me you gotta kill me
And when I'm gone, you can still feel me, on the real, B
The shit is eternal, I rock the heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven, I raise hell, till it's Heaven
Recognize, the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me, nigga, it's bad luck to cross me
I'm poppin' Crystal,
shooting game like missiles
As projected, all hoes affected by this style
I mack like Goldie,
go back like the oldie
But the goody, pulling R&B bitches wearing hoodies
They don't be knowin' the way I be flowin'
When I be goin' I be running the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme, the way that you do things with a swing,
and have 'em rocking like
You say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm, I produce like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom, for greater understandin'
I'm landing blows
And knocking sense into those that oppose me
Enticing when slicing through tracks
You're screaming, "Jesus Christ, he's back!"
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map, so give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, fuck that!
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible, even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beating me will never come like a nun or tomorrow.
I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creeping through your way
With a thousand little dudes
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's trying to be the best
And even in dying, couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin'
Ever since L said, "Throw three G's in!"
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself,
I get up
My crew be delivering hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killin' the shit in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect to
catch wreck
cassette deck.
I'm so ahead of my time, my parents haven't met yet
I'm feeling like Billy Bathgate,
my rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probably got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a gassed head,
got loot cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'mma beat your faggot ass half-dead
I stomp white cops till they life stops
For a low price, hops, cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war
Cause my crew will kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time my MAC-11 bucks
I'm killing at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike, I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit, ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple, hun
Fuck love! All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown emcee's I be attacking quick
I'm on some rapping shit and some car jacking shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black Ac', and put the gat to his cap, click-clack. Sorry, Jack, but get up out of that!
My .38 works great, so make a mistake and hesitate
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speakin'
He started reachin'
so I left him sleepin' with his temple leakin'
Aight, back to my man Jay-Z
[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage
And no I don't have it; I get it together like a marriage
I'm seeking all rappers, I'm on my P's and Q's and carrots
Y'all don't understand, well
Goddamn, don't you know my status?
I'm flowing the fattest, mmm that is, mmm, I'm the baddest
No need to explain, my name the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me, they find I'm a bit much to swallow
You're thinking that's hollow
The rhythm is too r-rugged to follow
I hit you like bam, biggity bam, bam, biggity bam
Let me take a little breath goddamn
The kid is a wizard
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
You know I'm gonna end ya
Uh, the nigga don't play, hey, the nigga don't play, hey
Hahahhhh, here I come a-g-g-gain, run, up up up in
Niggas are do ducking, I'm boo buckin, fuck it,
I'm wild
But a boo boo boo bam, what you
Niggas gonna do to the man
I see you brought your little crew... and?
I'm still coming with velocity
Ain't none of the clowns fucking around
Ain't none of clowns standing their ground
With the crowned prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on sweat now, Jay-Z's on, be gone to the next town
Punk, jump up and get beat down
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Ladies be coming out of their seats now
Shit I got crazy skills, it's a pity the way I'm rippin'
Like dunnanna dunnanna di-di-dun dun ditty
gimme G's
Baby, baby, with crazy ease, watch Jay-Z get crazy G's
