Dress it up and make it real for me
Whatever that fucking means
Dirty soda in a styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
Til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gone let 'em have it
Ballin' like the March Madness
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's living lavish
Like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch, the molly made me fuck her even though she average
Dirty muddy in a cup
45 by my gut
My young nigga in a cut
Taking you out for some Jordans
Let's count this money, no rushin'
I'm on a one way, flushin'
Loud pack smelling musty
These fuckin' police can't touch me
These bogus police can't touch me
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me
Apply the pressure with the VVS
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Drive the foreign like it was a Ch-skrrrrtt
Lift it up and gone and off-set it
Fuck a cougar like she Halle Berry
Future Hendrix, Dirty Sprite, legendary
Dirty soda in a styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
Til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gone let 'em have it
Ballin' like the March Madness
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's living lavish
Like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch, the molly made me fuck her even though she average
Fuck on a basic bitch
We gone wake up and smoke us a blunt and fuck
She gone keep it so real with a nigga that-
I'ma come back and always gone fuck with her
Bend a curve in a Spur like its a MARTA bus
I was working and serving in Nautica
I get high 'til I'm higher than Mercury
Fuck around teach you that recipe
Fuck around, you gone be out of here
Make her say ha like a nigga was Juve
Soon as that work hit the city, we move it
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Take the tool inside the club, just incase a nigga ever gotta use it
Get a pint of code an pour it up, nigga
Dirty soda in a styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
Til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gone let 'em have it
Ballin' like the March Madness
