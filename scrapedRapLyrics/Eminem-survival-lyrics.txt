This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps
And standing for something;
fuckin' acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over  enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought
Of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon
Nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff,
came up rough
Came to ruffle feathers,
nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, cause
[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals
I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank
Maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can
Man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter  I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka, and if I don't make the cut, what?
Like I give a fuck
But I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow
I'm stabbing myself with a fucking knife in the gut
While I'm wiping my butt
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood
You're in a fight with a nut
Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win,
biting the dust
It'll just make me angrier;
wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?
[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle
Now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it  it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue,
I'm showing you the flow no one do
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you!
Self-esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof
Cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be allergic to failure, cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go at you then a-chieve!
[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
