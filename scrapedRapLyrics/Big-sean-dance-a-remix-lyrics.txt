Stop! Now make that motherfucker hammer time like
Wobble-dy wobble-dy wa wobble wobble
Im st-stacking my paper my wallet look like a bible
I got girlies half naked that shit look like the grotto
How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal
Drop that ass make it boomerang
Take my belt off, bitch Im Pootie Tang
Tippy tow tippy tay you gon' get a tip today
Fuck that you gonna get some dick today
I walk in with my crew and Im breaking they necks

They pay me respect they pay me in checks
And if she look good she pay me in sex (do it)
Bounce that ass (ass) its the roundest
You the best, you deserve a crown bitch

Ass so fat, all these bitches pussies is throbbin
Bad bitches, Im your leader, Phantom by the meter
Somebody point me to the best ass-eater
Tell 'im "Pussy clean!" I tell them "Pussy squeaky!"
Niggas give me brain cause all of them niggas geeky
If he got a mandingo, then I buy him a dashiki
And bust this pussy open in the islands of Waikiki
Kiss my ass and my anus, cause its finally famous
And its finally soft, yeah, its finally solved!
I dont know, man, guess them ass shots wore off!
Bitches aint poppin, Google, my ass
Only time you on the net is when you Google my ass
