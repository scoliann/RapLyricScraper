Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
So which you want, the cheese or the cheeks
You want the cheeks but she want the cheese,
a bitch gotta eat
Im havin the epiphany you niggas aint shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum Im from
Im a Southside nigga, yeah Im bout mine
You be that next nigga coroners come outline
You aint made of what Im made of
You a bum nigga with a bum bitch, her shoes come from Bakers
Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers
What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that?
We on now; we pullin off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling,
down the top
Strapped with the Glock wont pull it out a lot but front, Ill make it pop
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
We up, nigga!
Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh)
Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video get you locked in a bing
Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck her or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids,
K-Dot
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Good pussy for dinner, bomb kush for breakfast
D colored VS stones around my neck bitch
Seat back, music bumpin,
The bread,
Im in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame
[Verse 4: Kidd Kidd]
Round the world tourin, the city got boring
Bury me a G
Blue Ferrari, so many iron horses
Living life with no worries
My gun got a Zodiac sign, it's a Taurus
Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e
M-Zone Rida Gang end the story
Oops, that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry
She call me daddy too, we should be on Maury
Purple label Ralph Lauren,
kick game like Atari
