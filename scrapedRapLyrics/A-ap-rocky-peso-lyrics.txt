I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported,
just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that
7
Them 6's, them Benzes,
I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up,
smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting,
you ain't round my clique for nothing
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause every day we on our pesos
(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)
Cause every day we on our pesos
Your bitch just said I'm hot, man I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale,
cocaine,
X pills
Import, export,
Harlem catching rec still
So mami show me how that neck feel
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill
