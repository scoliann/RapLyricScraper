[Chorus x2]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
Bitch I got the mac or the 40
Turn a bitch to some macaroni
Tell me how you want it I'm on it
I really mean it I'm just not recordin'
Give lil bro the choppa for all you oppas
Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta
You are an impostor, ain't got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly
I really hate niggas I'm a Nazi
Love wearin' all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I'm feelin' Godly
Hop out like Coke, I ain't gotta park it
Fuck is y'all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can't get 'em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won't stop callin'
IBGM be the clique, bitch, you see us scorin'
V.I.P in the plural, while yo section borin'
Got a bitch that set it off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah
You rollin' around wit yo nieces, bitch you T.T
Mind full of money, got a heart full of demons
Mobbin' like Italians, we really take yo fingas
Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne
Have you singin' like Alicia, fuck wit my family
They be like you little, but got damn she spazzin'
Do the whole crew, my bitches freak nasty
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
Bitch I got the Tommy no Hilfiger
Lil Dej ain't bout it, bitch how you figure
I don't do no drugs, I be off liquor
So lifted, flyer than yo girl, baby gone and take my picture
See I gotta get this money, my palms itchin'
Niggas gossip like hoes, most of 'em bitches
I don't wanna do no songs, I don't wanna kick it
And I ain't signin' to no label, bitch I'm independent
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
