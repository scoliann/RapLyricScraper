225 is that area code or somethin', put that on map quest
Sike, thats the wrong number!
Sweet dolla tea from McDonalds, I drink that
Super Hot Fire, I spit that
2 and a half men, I watch that!
(I'm not a rapper)
Aight check me out
Glasses, jacket, shirt
Call me glasses, jacket shirt-man
Or call me Supa Hot boy, hundred degrees, leather jacket
Cause I'm Supa Hot, boy
(I'm not a rapper)
Is this what they put me up against, Supa Hot, I never heard of you
I'm lookin at him, like is he stupid, I'm bout' to murder you
My crew ain't waiters, but still servin' you
I'm like shaq, I get fouled and then he's back to drop 32.
Your girl always confuse my john with a spoon, pops
Yeah she's tall enough to ride, Knotts
They told me I had to battle, I was like this is who they set up
I'm like naw it can't be, this must be a setup
First of all, I'm not your friend, so stop lookin' at me
Second of all, I'm not a rapper, so stop rappin' at me
I'm bout to end this man's whole career,
but I'm not a rapper
Look, boom, bam, bop, bada bop, boom, Pow!
