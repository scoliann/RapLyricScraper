[Intro]
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Ching, ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching, ching, gettin' paid over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Ching, ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching, ching, gettin' paid over here
I wanna kiss you, girl, I wanna kiss you
Girl, I wanna love you
Oh, am I moving too fast?
Fuck that (Well, well, well...)
Your momma must have taught you well
Cause you taste so purified
Need to get it while it's hot cause I'm cold at times
Open up to me and drop your guard, I need the proof
Constantly to know if you still have a heart
Cause a nigga done fucked up I feel like I lucked up, I know it's hard
But hop in your car and bring it to me
Promise to love you, and obey
And hit it more than once a day
Girl I say that genuinely
Fuck that bitch... It's what you say
Bring it over
Bring it over
Baby bring it over
Bring it over to me
Now, baby, bring it over
Bring it over
Baby bring it over to me
Bring it, bring it
But does he kiss you, girl?
Does he kiss you, girl, does he love you?
(Tell me what he do)
Am I moving too fast?
Fuck that (My, my, my...)
I thought you were always mine (Yea, I thought some shit)
I'll play my role, just give me the script
Time to let go, tell him give you your shit
Hop in your whip, girl
I'm back in the 6, girl
Still need a bad bitch who thirsty
Shawty holla at me if you heard me
Promise to love you, and obey
And hit it more than once a day
Girl I say that genuinely
Fuck that bitch... It's what you say
Bring it over
Bring it over
Baby bring it over
Bring it over to me
Now, baby, bring it over
Bring it over
Baby bring it over to me
Bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it
