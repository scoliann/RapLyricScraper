[LAURENS]
Alright, alright. Thats what Im talkin about!
maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler
A toast to the groom!
To the bride!
Who is always by your side
And the hope that you provide
May you always
Be satisfied
To the union!
To the revolution!
Rewind
To the union!
Rewind
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember
dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream
that you cant quite place
But Alexander, Ill never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said Hi,
I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, evry part aflame
This is not a game
[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Im sure I dont know what you mean. You forget yourself
[HAMILTON]
Youre like me. Im never satisfied
[ANGELICA]
Is that right?
[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler
[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
[ANGELICA]
Wheres your famly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant.
Theres a million things I havent done but
Just you wait, just you wait
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? Its
The feeling of freedom, of seein the light
Its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes
three minutes
Evrything we said in total agreement
its
A dream
its a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, its a bit of a stance.
I asked about his famly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
hes flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he cant even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sisters face and she is

[ELIZA]
Helpless

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is

[ELIZA]
Helpless

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just

[ELIZA]
Helpless

[ANGELICA]
And I realize
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time
[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
Im about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way
Number one!
Im a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so Im the one
So Im the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesnt mean I want him any less
Schuyler?
My sister
Number two!
Hes after me cuz Im a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status
Id
Have to be nave to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now thats his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
Thank you for all your service
[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it
Ill leave you to it
Number three!
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him shed be silently resigned
Hed be mine
Im fine
[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Shed be lying
But when I fantasize at night
Its Alexanders eyes
As I romanticize
what might
Have been if I hadnt sized him
Up so quickly
At least I keep his eyes in my life
To the groom!
From your sister
Who is always by your side
To your union


And the hope that you provide




May you always

Be satisfied
Shell be happy as


His bride
To the union!
To the revolution!
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
