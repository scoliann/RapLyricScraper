[Produced By Dave Free]
Wicked as Aleister Crowley
You niggas know me
[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out of Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We'd stand a chance against the military tonight
Babylon, Babylon, out my window all I see is Babylon
On the news, all I see is Babylon
And all niggas do is just babble on
Money and hoes, want money and hoes
If I sold dope, I'd have plenty of flows
If I was from the projects like Jay Rock
I would've more than likely slang rocks
All my life I done been around Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs, just to name a few
I do drugs, Momma say it's in my blood
But she don't know what the fuck I've been through
To creep through the back door
The typical black boy in the good old USA
Before I pushed rhymes like weight
I used to wanna play for the NBA (Hey)
Fuck I'm doing talking 'bout pineal gland?
Ancient ways of Sumerians?
Ain't nothing wrong with a righteous man (Damn)
This why I had to write this, man
For my niggas on the corner, selling water
To somebody daughter, fluctuating prices, man
I ain't got no gavel, I ain't tryin' to fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free, I ain't tryin' to be nobody's chattel
[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out of Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We'd stand a chance against the military tonight
[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
(Extra pills, extra pills)
Them AK clips stay extra peeled
Smoking on some of that extra kill
Purple Urkel, that Jaleel
I put that on everythang
If we could link up every gang
And niggas is willing to bear the pain
We'd put the White House lights out today
Okay-kay-kay
We mobbin' like we the black KKK
Don't forget my a.k.a. Mayday
Pee on your Ph. D. or your AA
Hey, Dear Barack
I know you just a puppet, but I'm giving you props
You lying to the public like it ain't nothin'
And I just love it, I hope it don't stop
I don't give a damn, nigga, bang that block!
I don't give a fuck, nigga, bang that Glock!
I seen an image of Hitler in the picture
When the Twin Towers dropped
Peep the concept
You've got progress, you've got congress
We protest in hopes they confess
Just proceed on your conquest
I ain't got no gavel, I ain't finna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free, I ain't finna be nobody's chattel
[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out of Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We'd stand a chance against the military tonight
(Extra pills, extra pills)
Nose candy rain like Soul 4 Real
My baby needs some Enfamil
So bags get stuffed like Oprah grill
Pull around, come back, oh, for real?
Top blew off, loafers in teal
Get lined up like homeless meals
Feeling if he know how being homeless feels?
Okay-kay-kay.
Don't try to stop it, get in my way
You'll get stomped like a Broadway play
AK melee make you obey, okay?
Feel my pain, going insane, I'm ashamed
Cause I ain't got shit but an EBT card
From a fiend that owe me and it's in her daughter name
How the fuck is they 'posed to eat?
How the fuck am I 'posed to eat?
Got a nigga in the streets, no health care
Tryin' to slang weed just to put shoes on his feet
So fuck you! You don't give a fuck about me
Can't get a job if they drug test me
Got a nigga stressed, depressed
Got a feeling in his chest and the world's stripped of happiness
I ain't got no gavel, I ain't tryin' to fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free, I ain't finna be nobody's shadow
