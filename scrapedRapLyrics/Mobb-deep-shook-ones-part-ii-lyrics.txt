[Intro]
Word up, son, word, yeah
To all the killers and a hundred dollar billers
For real, niggas who ain't got no feelings
Check it out now
[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare
Beware of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team, and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight; my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only 19, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothing really,
ayo Dun, spark the philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burning sensation
Getting closer to God in a tight situation
Now take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
[Hook]
Son, they shook, cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Living the live that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son; he's just a shook one
[Verse 2: Havoc]
For every rhyme I write it's 25 to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguarding my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty thinking mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claiming that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears
You'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects; my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I going to burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin',
digging my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
Cause long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my people
React quick, spit lyrics like MAC's, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleeping, cause I'm creeping
Son, they shook, cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Living the live that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son; he's just a shook one
To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
G-yeah, the whole Bridge
Queens get the money
41st side, keeping it real,
Queens get the money
